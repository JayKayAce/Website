## Function of the G Idea Exchange Committee
The G Idea Exchange (GIE) Committee's mission is to help new ideas become new open-source toolkits and libraries for the community. It does this by facilitating the discussion of new ideas on the [G Idea Exchange forum](https://forums.ni.com/t5/G-Idea-Exchange/idb-p/g-idea-exchange) and bringing awareness to the community of LabVIEW tools that currently exists through the [Awesome LabVIEW Github List](https://github.com/gcentral/AwesomeLabVIEW).

<p>Jesper Kjær Sørensen is a Systems Engineer at GPower. He holds certifications as a LabVIEW and Teststand Developer and is proficient in Python. Jesper has been programming in LabVIEW since 2006, in Python since approximately 2012, and TestStand since 2018. At GPower, he has contributed to numerous projects, with a particular focus on measuring Wind Turbine Blade Dynamics. His passion lies in creating SOLID code and applying SOLID programming principles, driving him to continuously enhance his skills. Jesper prioritizes amalgamating the strengths of various programming languages to automate manual processes efficiently.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jesper serves as a trained Scrum Master in SAFe 5 and assumes the role of Product Owner for GPower Expression Parser for LabVIEW, an expression evaluation toolkit designed for faster computations.</p>
<p>Prior to joining GPower, Jesper amassed experience across various industries. Notably, he was involved in certifying, developing, and testing methanol-based high-temperature fuel cells during his tenure at Serenergy, now Advent Technology. His responsibilities included the development of custom fuel cell stack test stations over a span of three years. Subsequently, he transitioned to managing CE certification and maritime approval of fuel cells. However, Jesper's true passion for application development and coding led him to pursue new challenges at GPower.</p>
<p>Residing in Denmark on a farm with his wife and daughter, Jesper enjoys spending his leisure time on photography and embarking on scouting trips with his daughter as a means to unwind from the digital world.</p>
