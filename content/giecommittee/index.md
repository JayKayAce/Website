## Function of the G Idea Exchange Committee
The G Idea Exchange (GIE) Committee's mission is to help new ideas become new open-source toolkits and libraries for the community. It does this by facilitating the discussion of new ideas on the [G Idea Exchange forum](https://forums.ni.com/t5/G-Idea-Exchange/idb-p/g-idea-exchange) and bringing awareness to the community of LabVIEW tools that currently exists through the [Awesome LabVIEW Github List](https://github.com/gcentral/AwesomeLabVIEW).

{{< personcard image="ErichSchlieper.jpg" side="left" name="Erich Schlieper" linkedinname="erichschlieper">}}
<p>Erich is a CLD and Professional Engineer (MN) with over 20 years experience engineering systems and testing widgets.  He has been solving problems and fixing code since LabVIEW version 5.  Erich has been involved in planning the local Minneapolis/Saint Paul User's Group for the last 6 years and has been a member of the G Idea Exchange Committee for the last year and a half.  He has worked on projects big and small, trying to defy the inner desire of every software developer everywhere to rewrite every application.  He prefers to be working on systems where there is a strong hardware and software component.  He also enjoys getting into legacy code to find out what makes it tick and adding new features.  His favorite saying born from years of experience is "There's nothing more permanent than a short term solution.</p>

<p>Eric is a Research & Development Engineer at Duke University in Durham, NC, where he currently works on embedded sensing systems. He was introduced to LabVIEW in 2016 when he built test and measurement systems for teaching lab experiments. Outside of LabVIEW, he enjoys experimenting with new baking recipes (ask about the prinzregententorte), Duke basketball, and curling (yes, the sport played with brooms on ice). One of several Erics on the committee, he (and the other Erics) would like to assure everyone that they have no plans for a hostile or non-hostile takeover.</p>
