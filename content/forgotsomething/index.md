## Adding Resources to GCentral Yourself


There are two non-financial ways you could also contribute by adding content to GCentral to make it an even more valuable resource. The two main places to add content to GCentral are:

If you haven't created an author profile, create that first by:
 1. Fork the repo or update your repo if forked previously.
 2. Add an author file to /data/authors folder. Name it uniquely as a *.json file with the following content:
```
{
    "name": "Q",
    "image" : "authors/QAuthorPic.jpg",
    "bio": "Ravenclaw, Engineer, Builder, Programmer",
    "social": [
        { "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/quentin-q-alldredge" }
    ]
}
```
```
Where:	name is the name you want to be displayed in quotation marks
		image is the path and filename with the author folder "authors/[image filename]
		bio is whatever you want recommended a few words to a sentence
		social is any social links you want to link to, recommend at least you linkedin address
```
 3. Add an author image to the /assets/img/authors folder. It is best if it is square between 256 and 768 pixels.
 4. It is recommended to have Hugo development set up ([see how here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#Prerequisites))..

 2. If you want to add images, move your file to a custom subfolder and rename it index.md.
 3. Edit the file the front matter, or metadata at the front of the file, should be edited as follows:
