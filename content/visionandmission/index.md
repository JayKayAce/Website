## Mission Statement 
GCentral, a non-profit organization led by volunteer representatives of the LabVIEW community, is committed to empowering this vibrant community by fostering an environment where collaboration and innovation thrive. We are dedicated to democratizing access to comprehensive training and establishing ourselves as the central source of information for the LabVIEW community, ensuring every member has the tools and knowledge necessary to advance. As the central hub for information, resources, and support, GCentral pledges to serve as the foundational platform for those seeking to enhance their skills, share expertise, or discover collaborative opportunities. By uniting our community around the pillars of education, accessibility, and collaboration, we strive to enable each individual—and the community as a whole—to create the best versions of themselves and their work, paving the way for a future marked by progress, inclusivity, and shared success. Our leadership, comprised entirely of volunteers from within the LabVIEW community, embodies our commitment to serving the community's needs and aspirations, ensuring that GCentral remains by and for the community it seeks to uplift.
