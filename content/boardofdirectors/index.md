{{< personcard image="ChrisCilino.jpg" side="right" name="Chris Cilino" linkedinname="chriscilino" position="President, Treasurer" >}}

<p>I have a passion for technology, teamwork, and mentorship. In my 20+ year career, I've employed all three in the context of using LabVIEW in creating applications and engaging with the LabVIEW community. I started my career at National Instruments in Applications Engineering, then Software Development in DAQ R&D (where I got my <a href="http://bit.ly/ChrisCilino_CLABadge">CLA in 2014</a>), and then finally in LabVIEW marketing where I owned programs such as the <a href="https://labviewwiki.org/wiki/LabVIEW_Champions">LabVIEW Champions</a>. I spent the next three years at Cirrus Logic as the LabVIEW Framework architect. I was responsible for <a href="https://bit.ly/ChrisCilino_2018Keynote">reducing the time and cost of validation</a> by creating software that kept pace with Cirrus' rapidly evolving products. During my time at Cirrus, I attained the status of <a href="http://bit.ly/ChrisCilino_ChampionBadge">LabVIEW Champion</a> in 2017, and then passed the <a href="https://learn.ni.com/center-of-excellence">Center of Excellence</a> audit in 2018. I've given numerous presentations at the <a href="https://bit.ly/ChrisCilino_Presentations">CLA Summits</a> and <a href="https://www.petranway.com/implementation">distributed my toolkits</a> for use.</p>
<p>Most recently I've joined <a href="https://www.dmcinfo.com/">DMC</a> as a project engineering and LabVIEW Consultant.</p>
<p>In parallel, I've started <a href="https://labviewwiki.org/wiki/GCentral">GCentral</a>, a non-profit organization with the mission of improving the LabVIEW Community's engineering capability by removing barriers to collaboration.</p>
<p>I believe LabVIEW is critical to focussing an engineer's talents on solving problems while minimizing time in learning the tools. LabVIEW lets us do engineering better than any tool I found.</p>
