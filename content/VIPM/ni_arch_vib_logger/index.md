Full Description:
Many cRIO applications for embedded data logging include common operations like communications, configuration, data acquisition, data logging, error logging, analysis and triggering.  This cRIO Vibration Data Logger Reference Design is one example presenting all these concepts working together and serves as a starting point for application development.
