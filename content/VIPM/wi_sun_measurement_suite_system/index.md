Full Description:
SUNs enable multiple applications to operate over shared network resources, providing monitoring and control of a utility system. SUN devices are designed to operate in very large-scale, low-power wireless applications and often require using the maximum power available under applicable regulations, in order to provide long-range, point-to-point connections. The multi-rate and multi-regional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MR-OFDM) PHY is RF band agnostic and supports data rates ranging from 50 kb/s to 800 kb/s. The subcarrier spacing is constant and is equal to 10416-2/3 Hz (or 31250/3 Hz). The symbol rate is 8-1/3 ksymbol/s, which corresponds or 120 ?s per symbol. This symbol includes a quarter-duration cyclic prefix (CP; 24 microsec) and a base symbol (96 microsec).

MaxEye Technologies provides generation and analysis functions in LabVIEW for generating and analyzing the Wi-SUN standard complaint signals using National Instruments Vector Signal Generators (NI VSG) and Vector Signal Analyzers (NI VSA) or Vector Signal Transceivers (NI VST). The IEEE 802.15.4g Standard supports multiple Physical Layer modes; the current version of the toolkits supports the following physical layer mode.

i.	MR OFDM Physical Layer

Note: VI Package Manager 2014 is required to install the package, before installing and Uninstalling the package run VIPM and LabVIEW as administrator.
