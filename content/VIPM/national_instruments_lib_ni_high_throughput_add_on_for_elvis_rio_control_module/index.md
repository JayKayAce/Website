Full Description:
With the NI High Throughput Add-On for ELVIS RIO Control Module, you can create applications on the NI ELVIS RIO Control Module using the high-throughput FPGA personality. FPGA personaflities consist of predefined FPGA bitfiles for you to program with your NI ELVIS RIO Control Module. The NI ELVIS RIO Control Module high-throughput FPGA personality supports high-speed analog or digital data access. You can use the high-throughput personality for projects in need of waveform data.

**Note** Before installing the High Throughput Add-On for ELVIS RIO Control Module, you must install **LabVIEW**, the **LabVIEW Real-Time Module**, and the **LabVIEW ELVIS RIO Control Toolkit**. The High Throughput FPGA Personality VIs appear on the **NI ELVIS RIO CM** palette after you install the High Throughput Add-On for ELVIS RIO Control Module.
