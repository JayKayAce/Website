Vendor: IlluminatedG

Author(s): Derrick Bommarito
 
Full Description:
Provides easier axis, button, and POV mapping. The library is extensible by allowing children classes to be created to add special behavior for specific devices.

Malleable VIs are utilized to support creating axis, button, and POV enumerations for more readable code development. Enumerations are included for XBox gamepad controls as well as a gamepad tester for XBox controllers.

POV direction can be retrieved as a compass direction in degrees or as an enumeration that specifies the closest 45Â° named direction.

Planned features include asynchrous device polling for event-driven updates as well as device enumeration instead of LV's device index based selection.
