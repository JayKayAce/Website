Full Description:
This IP is meant to be a drop in solution for quickly calculating the power of the full bandwidth of the input signal. This has many RF applications; most RF standards have a power requirement associated with them. For instance, IEEE 802.11 may not exceed 40mW per 6-dBi Antenna gain in the Americas. Specifically, this IP is designed for the IQ architecture utilized in the NI PXIe-5644/45R Vector Signal Transceivers. I and Q must be in, or coerced to, <Â±, 18, 1> fixed point. The operation of this IP is discussed further in the documentation
