Full Description:
========================================================================
**DENSO Robot Library: ** LabVIEW Driver for RC8
========================================================================

** Description **

The DENSO Robot Library provides an easy way to interface between LabVIEW and the DENSO Robotics hardware*.

The DENSO Robot Library intends to support a wide range of applications from just reading status signals to starting task programs to sending motion commands directly from a LabVIEW VI the library is capable of handling it. 

In order to expand our technical support service to our customers, the library is designed to have high affinity with DENSO's native programming language called PacScript. This tight relationship between the library and the robot controller helps both customers that may be more familiar with one environment than the other to easily find their way. A similar thought was put for error handling, the library will output similar error codes and error description as if you were programming straight from the DENSO software and will help you to better understand what the issue is and how to solve it.  
Communication between LabVIEW and the DENSO Robotics hardware is done via bCAP (binary Controller Access Protocol) with a server running as a background process in the DENSO hardware which reduces setup time.

It is the purpose of DENSO Robotics that the DENSO Robot Library becomes a robust and powerful tool while also take advantage of the LabVIEW graphical programming environment.
