Full Description:
This tool is designed to help programmers capture and apply complex UI configurations to any LV VI, both edit and run-time. Using the User Interface Manager Tool and its API you will be able to configure your UI any way you want, capture that configuration, export and import it from XML file and apply any previously captured configuration at any moment. Thanks to this you can seperate the configuration of your UIs from your application functionality and still be able to achieve any effect you could using standard VI Server methods and properties. 

If the User Interface Property you want to capture is not handled by the standard provided UIPs, you can easily create a new one, using the UIP Class Template. With this, by providing your own implementation for 5 simple menthods, you will be able to capture any property from any control in your VI.

Some of the use cases that can be easily handled by this tool: localization of the UI, changing visibility of controls, changing the enabled state of controls, changing the color scheme of the whole UI and many more...
