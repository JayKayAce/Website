Full Description:
A toolkit of .vis that allow the programmatic extraction of icons from EXE and DLL files.  This utility also can determine the windows associated icon of any file and extract it.  All icons are extracted and converted to LabVIEW image data types.

The main examples are installed as tools in LabVIEW under the 'Tools>IconExpress' menu.  Ensure that LabVIEW is restarted to refresh the Tools menu.

'Create Directory Tree' is an example showing how to create a directory tree from a top level directory and add icons for the associated files to the tree control.  You can also save the icon to a bitmap file by highlighting the file and saving.  These extracted icons can be used to create palette icons for example.

'Extract Icons from EXE' will extract all icons stored in an exe or Dll file and will show them in a tree control.  You can then select one of them and save it to a bitmap file, which can be used to create palette icons for example.
