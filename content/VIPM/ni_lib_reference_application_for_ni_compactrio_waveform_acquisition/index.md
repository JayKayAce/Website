Full Description:
Many reconfigurable I/O (RIO) applications acquire continuous blocks of data from multiple synchronized NI C Series modules. This reference application presents CompactRIO waveform data acquisition VIs and example source code that incorporate RIO best practices. These examples are easily modifiable to jump-start your application development.

Specifically, the project allows for both delta-sigma-based and non-delta-sigma-based module support, with common acquisition functions grouped into logical blocks. Examples cover multiple continuous and finite acquisition modes with waveform data types. Employed VIs push calibration and scaling operations onto the FPGA, perform a full complement of error checking, and allow for increased user control over CPU usage, all apt as the basis for application development.

The examples are very flexible and can adapt to many different hardware combinations. For most applications, only the FPGA VI needs to be modified.

Application Software: LabVIEW Full Development System 2010 or later
Toolkits and Add-Ons: LabVIEW FPGA Module 2010, LabVIEW Real-Time Module 2010
