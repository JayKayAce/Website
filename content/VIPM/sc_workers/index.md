Full Description:
Workers is an application framework for LabVIEW that combines the classic LabVIEW QMH template development style with LVOOP. Designed for use by anyone with basic LabVIEW skills, Workers decreases the time needed to develop multi-process applications in LabVIEW by creating your application's frame for you, allowing you to focus on the most important parts of your application: *the functional requirements of each QMH.*

The Workers SDK provides you with the following features:

**Familiar Development Style**
Workers QMHs are designed in the style of the LabVIEW QMH template, so that anyone at the Core 3 / CLD level can comfortably develop with the framework, even without LVOOP experience. For those with LVOOP experience, you can develop your applications using inheritance, producing a cleaner and minimal code base.

**Modular and Scalable QMHs**
Workers QMHs are modular and scalable, allowing you to quickly create the frame of an application with as many QMHs as you need and then reuse them through your projects. And through the use of LVOOP you can extend the common functionality of each QMH.

**Development Tools**
The Workers development tools provide you with several tools that are designed to maximize your productive with the framework. For example, the Create/Add Worker tool allows you to scale the frame of a multi-process application, and the Worker Library allows you to copy functional Workers directly into your applications, so that you don’t have to re-invent the wheel. Many other tools are provided as well.

**Local and Remote Debugging**
Debug your Workers applications either locally or remotely, using the Workers Debug Server. It doesn’t matter if your Workers application is running in the LabVIEW development environment, as an executable or on a real-time target over a network, the Workers Debug Server allows you to see what is happening within your applications at run-time and allows you to jump into parts of your application for efficient debugging.

**Designed for Windows and NI real-time targets**
Workers allows you to develop applications on both Windows and NI real-time targets, allowing you to seamlessly move your QMHs between targets, so that you no longer need to develop separate code for different targets.

**BSD-3 License**
The Workers Framework Core is made available under the BSD-3-Clause open-source license, allowing you to freely use the framework in private, academic and commercial projects without restriction.
