Vendor: LAVA

Full Description:
This package contains tools for designing user interfaces.
It consists of a set of VIs to create special effects. Also included, a library to help align rectangles to properly calculate distribution of objects with their known boundaries. It comes with a dynamic core engine and a series of base classes for message box dialogs.

The customized controls have all been removed except a few. The buttons will be provided as add-ons to this package. This decision's been made because the buttons might be in greater number in the future and this package would quickly become enormous. Most users will likely use a set of icons, and separating the icons packages from the UI Tools will garantee that the user keeps his LabVIEW folders/packages under control.
