Full Description:
A LabVIEW library for easy data exchange with the TwinCAT System (2.x und 3.x) from Beckhoff or with Beckhoff Ethernet IO systems. The data exchange is based on the ADS interface from Beckhoff.

The library can be used to create visualizations for TwinCAT PLC programs or integrate Beckhoff Ethernet IO systems in LabVIEW.

There are two versions of the library. One uses the TwinCAT ADS Dll for data exchange. The other version is based in LabVIEW TCP functions and can therefore also be used on LabVIEW RealTime systems. 

The library provides the following functionality:
-    Reading and writing data by symbol names
-    Reading and writing lists of symbols
-    Reading and writing data by address
-    Event driven reading (Notifications)
-    Reading and writing device state
-    Browsing symbol table
-    Conversion functions for data types

It is possible to create a buffered data transfer from TwinCAT PLC to LabVIEW to stream variable data lossless from PLC to LabVIEW. 

**Licensing**
 A developement license is needed to use the library. It is protected with a simple mechanism. An activation key has to be entered in the block diagramm. Each company will receive a different activation key.

**Required Software**
The dll based version needs TwinCAT or the TwinCAT ADS router installed on the local system. See help file for details.
