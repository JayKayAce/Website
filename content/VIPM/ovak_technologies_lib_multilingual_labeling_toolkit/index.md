Full Description:
Multilingual Labeling Toolkit is designed as a useful tool for software engineers to build multilingual graphical user interfaces. This is, particularly, targeted to software engineers who develop graphical user interfaces and to LabVIEW developers who are interested in building multilingual applications. The Multilingual Labeling Toolkit can be used not only to design the application, but also to enhance complete applications, so as to make them suitable for multilingual use.

System requirement: The system language should be the same that the toolkit is translating the GUI elements captions to.
