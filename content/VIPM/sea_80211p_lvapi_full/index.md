Full Description:
The **SEA 802.11p Add-On for LabVIEW - FULL API** delivers a suite to build V2X (Vehicle-To-Anything) related applications in LabVIEW. This package provides: (1) MON functions palette (API) for monitoring and timing manipulation, (2) RFC functions palette (API) for measurement and validation of RF-signals, (3) Host Control Manager (HCM-Full) as abstraction layer beween the APIs and the local V2X communication hardware, (4) examples, (5) user documentation.
**Compatible OS Versions:** Windows 7, Windows 10
**Software Requirements:**
- LabVIEW RTE 2015 SP1 (required for HCM)
- NI-VST 15 (or higher) Instrument Design Libraries (required for HCM) for NI PXIe-5644
- NI-USRP 15 (or higher) Instrument Driver Software (required for HCM) for NI USRP-92953/54
**Hardware Requirements:**
- NI PXIe-5644 (VST) or
- NI USRP-2953/54 (SDR)
**Important Notes:** 
**1.** HCM requires activation for operation after a 30-days trial period.
**2.** Older versions of the HCM are not automatically uninstalled during this installation, so multiple versions can co-exist. If older versions are no more used we strongly recommend to uninstall them to keep the system clean.
**Compatibility Note:
HCM 1.8.x is compatible with older versions of the 802.11p API (1.7.x or older). However, the new 802.11p API (starting from 1.8.x) must be used with the HCM version 1.8.x or newer.**
