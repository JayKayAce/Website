Redirecting to https://www.vipm.io/package/jki_lib_dotnet_system_exec

Vendor: JKI

Author(s): Javier Ruiz
 
Full Description:
Allows you to create and asynchronously launch an instance of the .NET System Process in order to run any application (i.e. cmd.exe).  Use this library instead of the default LabVIEW System Exec vi. It configures the instance to redirect the stdout, stderr, and stdin so that LabVIEW can interface with them. Use the public events to register for the stdout and stderr events. Send strings to stdin using the stdin.write.vi. Run the provided example in order to see how the library works with running cmd.exe.

At JKI we develop software, architect solutions, and design user interfaces to automate, test, and control complex systems using a combination of LabVIEW and Python. If you are interested in working with JKI or want to learn more about how we can help your company please visit jki.net.
