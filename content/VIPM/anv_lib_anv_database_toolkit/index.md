Full Description:
ANV Database Toolkit (ANV DBT) is a toolkit, which helps developers design LabVIEW API for querying various databases. It allows to create VIs which can be used as API with the help of graphical user interface. When using these VIs, toolkit handles connection with the database, thus relieving developers of this burden in their applications. 

You need to run VIPM as administrator in order to properly install the toolkit.
