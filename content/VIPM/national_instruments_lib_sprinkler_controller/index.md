Full Description:
**Sprinkler Controller for NI myRIO**

The Sprinkler Controller App contains controller code capable of monitoring and controlling sprinkler lines. The real time code can run on the myRIO independently (i.e., without interacting with the Desktop Main code) to control the sprinkler lines without user interaction for extended periods of time. The user may configure the sprinkler zones and then let them run on their own, or manually control each zone. Manual mode may be controlled through Data Dashboard, allowing you to be anywhere in your yard and control which zone is currently watering. This can be useful while setting up or testing your sprinkler lines.

This app demonstrates the capability of the myRIO to control, monitor, and keep history information about a set of sprinkler lines. This is only one possible implementation of this kind or architecture. This code could be expanded or modified to control and monitor many different things.

The app comes with images and masks for two pre-defined lawn examples.  It can, however, be customized to work with any lawn.

Sprinkler valves not required for code to operate, but are required for full functionality. It may also be necessary to use a relay between the valves and the myRIO depending upon the valves you own.  The controller is compatible with any sprinkler valve that can be turned by a single digital line.
