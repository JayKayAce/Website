Vendor: Blue Origin

Author(s): Brent Justice
 
Full Description:
This package provides an improved drag and drop schema for:
- Listbox
- Multicolumn Listbox
- Tree

Notable advantages:
- Use cursor position to select indent level when dropping items onto a tree control.  (Not a native LabVIEW capability)
- Easily move items from 1 control to another control
- LVOOP abstraction

This toolkit entirely overrides the built-in drag/drop behavior with custom code.
Basically, this is an entirely G-written implentation of drag/drop behavior.
