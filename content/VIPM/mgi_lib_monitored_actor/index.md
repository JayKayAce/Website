Vendor: MGI

Full Description:
Monitored Actors aim to take the headache out of debugging Actor based implementations. It gives the developer a way to visualize all actors running on a system, and it gives them a way to use traditional debug tools (such as highlight execution and probes) in the already running actor.

All of these benefits come with no changes to the default actor framework and no additional code for you to implement.  To take advantage of these benefits, simply inherit from Monitored Actor instead of the built-in Actor class.  Making this switch is easy to do using the Monitored Actor Switcher- just select Monitored Actor Switcher from the Tools Menu.

Please see http://mooregoodideas.com/monitoring-actors for additional discussion of monitoring actors and this specific implementation.
