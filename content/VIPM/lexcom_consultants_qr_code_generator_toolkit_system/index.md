Full Description:
This package requires administrative privileges to install. Please restart VIPM and LabVIEW as an Administrator to continue installation. Using the toolkit however does not require such elevated user privileges. The toolkit supports deployment to binary executables when fully licensed & activated, but not in trial mode.

The QR Code Generator Toolkit offers a seamless integration option for QR code data and/or image creation into LabVIEW code. It supports the full QR code specification, without limitation on size or QR mode. The tool is partitioned into two main units: one for generating QR code data only, and the other for generating / exporting corresponding image data and/or files (in PNG or EPS format) from the QR data generated. The two main units can be used in a fully decoupled fashion, i.e. generating QR code data only, with custom image data also created / image file exported independently, later, elsewhere from existing QR data, or not at all. This implementation not only allows for modular use, but deployment to real-time & embedded targets.

This toolkit was developed solely in LabVIEW, is platform-independent, and does not rely on any other toolkit, library, pre-compiled code component, online algorithm, access to the internet, or any other external dependency. It is a standalone implementation of the full QR specification for all four QR modes of Numeric, Alphanumeric, Binary, and Kanji.
