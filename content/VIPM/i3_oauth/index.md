Full Description:
i3 OAuth is an implementation of the OAuth 1.0a protocol specified by the RFC 5849 standard. The toolkit can be used on Desktops that support Browser-based authentication as well as Embedded platforms when credentials are provided. The signature generation is flexible enough to allow the user to create worklows used with providers that require the older OAuth 1.0 or or have extensions to the OAuth 1.0a protocol.
