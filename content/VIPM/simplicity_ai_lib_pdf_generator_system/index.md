Benefits of PDF for Technical Reporting:

Tight control of technical documentation is an essential part of high accountability industries such as aerospace, automotive, medical devices and defence. By using PDF to store the output of an automated test and measurement system, a much greater degree of control on the data can be exerted, ensuring that the document represents the unaltered output from the equipment. Other file formats such as plain ASCII, CSV, HTML, Word and Excel have limited access control and are easily edited using tools available on a standard corporate desktop computer. With PDF even standard files need specialised software to edit and by enabling protection features, fine control of what a user can do with a document can be set.

PDF also provides a solution to long term electronic archiving of test result documents, by including a standard that maintains future readabilty. This can be an issue with other file formats, because as computer software, operating systems and even fonts become obsolete, it can be difficult to open files built using them. PDF/A is a much stricter subset of the PDF standard which aims to ensure documents can be accurately reproduced in the future.
