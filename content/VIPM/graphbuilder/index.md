Redirecting to https://www.vipm.io/package/graphbuilder

Vendor: Cyril Gambini

Author(s): Cyril Gambini
 
Full Description:
<color=green>GraphBuilder</color> allows you to add 'Nodes' (aka vertices) and 'Edges' to create directed graphs.
Several algorithms and traversal methods are available.
It is also possible to choose between rendering classes to represent a graph (GraphViz, Graphml, ...).
Each rendering class has its specific properties to allow a binary stream to be created accordingly.

This project is open-source (BSD-3 licence) and available on GitLab (<color=blue>https://gitlab.com/cgambini/graph-builder</color>).

If you want to support the author and the work done, you can buy me a coffe ;-)
