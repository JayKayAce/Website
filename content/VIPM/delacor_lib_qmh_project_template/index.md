Full Description:
This package installs the DQMH Project Template in the Getting Started>>Create Project window.

The DQMH project template is based on the NI Queued Message Handler Project Template (NI QMH). The DQMH project template improves on the NI QMH by providing safe, event-based message handling and scripting tools to make development easy, encourage same style between different developers in the same project and improve efficiency.

DQMH modules are best used in applications where there needs to be multiple modules running in parallel that communicate with each other.

DQMH modules can also be used for applications that have a single module, where the developer would benefit from having an API Tester has the capability of eavesdropping on the different DQMH events and messages.

Each module is implemented following a variation of the National Instruments Queued Message Handler and it has a Test DQMH Module API.vi to help troubleshoot, debug and eavesdrop on the communications between the DQMH Module and its calling code.
