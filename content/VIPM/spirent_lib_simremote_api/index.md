Vendor: Spirent

Full Description:
SimREMOTE is a package of remote control facilities that greatly enhances the flexibility of SimGEN.

Depending on the sale of your testing, these facilities can meet every need from simple remote control through to full integration with your test equipment and systems. 

SimREMOTE’s remote control facilities can be broken down into two categories:

1. Direct control - remotely configuring and controlling a scenario without using the PosApp interface. Examples of direct control are scenario selection, scenario start/stop, satellite power level variation and the logging of requested data.

2. Trajectory delivery - a special case of remote operation that uses vehicle motion data you provide, instead of PosApp’s built-in vehicle motion models


The LabVIEW library for SimREMOTE is suitable for use with all of Spirent’s GNSS simulator.

Disclaimer: Full support for Operating systems depend on the necessary configuration of the GNSS Simulator. All examples have been developed with the Position application engine mounted on Windows drive D:/

Note: VI Package Manager must be launched as an administrator in order to successfully install the dependency packages
