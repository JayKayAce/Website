Full Description:
Many Linux system functions use the standard Linux System Errors defined in errno.h for error handling. This LabVIEW library provides access to common errno definitions and mechanisms used in traditional C applications to provide error handling capabilities when errors are returned by system functions called via a Call Library Function Node.
