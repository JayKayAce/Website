Vendor: Greylock Technology

Author(s): Chris Roebuck
 
Full Description:
The Bookmark Project Provider is designed to make it relatively easy to add bookmarks or free text label comments to one or more VIs from the LabVIEW Project window without having to open the VI, navigate to its block diagram and adding the comment.

For convenience the option to select up to four (4) favourite bookmarks that can be quickly added with a single click is also provided along with the ability to customise the colour of the created free text label.

In the latest version you can Add Bookmarks (using the right click menu) to existing free text labels or invoke the Create New Bookmark UI from Quick Drop and finally, includes the Bookmark Suggester. The suggester is an easy and fast way of using existing or prefered bookmarks in a convieient filtered list.

**SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS**
Operating System: Windows 7 (or later) LabVIEW Version: 2015 (or later) 

The Bookmark Project provider is not compatible with LabVIEW for Mac OS or LabVIEW for Linux at this time.

**NOTE: Requires LabVIEW to be restarted after installation before project provider will be available.**

This package will replace a single VI in VI.lib with an alternative provided in a public forum by National Instruments as a mitigation for a Right Click Menu bug. You can learn more here:
