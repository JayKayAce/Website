Vendor: IlluminatedG

Author(s): Derrick Bommarito
 
Full Description:
Allows controlling Voicemeeter, Voicemeeter Banana, and Voicemeeter Potato from LabVIEW. A copy of the VoicemeeterRemote API manual can be found at https://download.vb-audio.com/Download_CABLE/VoicemeeterRemoteAPI.pdf and will be necessary to understand available parameters which are often specified by name with the API.

Some parameters are implemented as friendlier VIs such as controlling gain, reading device labels, and routing audio.
