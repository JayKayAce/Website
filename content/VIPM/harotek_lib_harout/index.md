Toolkit for non-destructive testing using Phased-Array Ultrasound.

This toolkit can be used to develop customized industrial applications for non-destructive testing (NDT) using ultrasonic phased arrays.

This toolkit includes a delay calculator for ultrasonic phased-arrays  and a Hardware API for the FocusPX from Olympus.

The VIs provided for the delay calculator include a full user interface and individual VIs to calculate delays for phased arrays to programmatically create customized configurations.

The API for the FocusPX from Olympus provides tools to initialize the FocusPX, control parameters in real time, and acquire data within LabVIEW at the full speed capabilities of the FocusPX. Communication with the FocusPX requires a computer with dedicated gigabit network card.
