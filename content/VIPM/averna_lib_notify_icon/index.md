Full Description:
Averna’s Notify Icon enables you to create a notification icon on the taskbar of the Windows OS. The API is based on the Notify Icon of .NET 2.0. It allows you to add an icon in the notification zone of the task bar, change the icon, create menu items and display notification balloons. The creation of the menu can be done through the menu editor (“rtm” files) of LabVIEW and the API matches the commonly used menu API of LabVIEW. The notification balloon can display three different message types to the user: Information, Warning and Error, each displayed using three different icons. The API uses events to give feedback relative to which menu has been selected. 

This toolkit requires VIPM 2014 and .NET framework 2.0 and is compatible with LabVIEW 2013 (32 and 64 bits) or later as well as Windows XP or later.
