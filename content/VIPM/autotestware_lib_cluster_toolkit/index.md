Insert, delete, replace, or reorder cluster elements.
Split cluster or index a subset of cluster elements.
Build new clusters from an existing cluster.
Convert array data to cluster data, convert cluster data to array data.
Take advantage of other functions such as sorting cluster arrays or accessing cluster information.
