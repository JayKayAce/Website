Full Description:
An open-source LabVIEW implementation of the S7 PLC network protocol using pure TCP/IP primitives, for talking to SIMATIC PLCs (and others) via Ethernet. The original source code was shared by Marc Christenson on NI's Example Program Code Exchange forum (link in the readme).

This is a reference implementation that has NOT been vetted for a production setting. It might or might not meet traditional requirements in terms of uptime, security, absence of bugs, etc. Use at your own risk!

The HSE Dokuwiki holds more information on the protocol and these VIs:
