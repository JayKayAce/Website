Full Description:
The HSE Application Template Wizard installs a project template which you can use from LabVIEW’s 'Create Project…' menu to start a new project based on our HSE Application Template.

The HSE Application Template is targeted at software built with and around DQMH modules. It is based on the HSE UI framework (which builds on the HSE flavour of DQMH®) and comes with basic functionality for module loading and configuration, UI management and logging/debugging. This template serves as springboard or starting point for our LabVIEW applications.
