Vendor: Mohammed Ashiq S

Author(s): Mohammed Ashiq S
 
Full Description:
It is a tool launched with LabVIEW.

It provides a nicer way to explore the pages of Front Panel **Tab Controls** & Block Diagram **Structures** with ease.

This tool is invoked without any additional actions as you scroll on your Tab/Structure.

And it does not steal your window focus.

When you move on to different places, it hides from the view.

Tool window can be **snapped** to **Left side** of the monitor or the **Right side**.
Additionally user can pin it to any custom position if needed.

And to mention, this tool works well with **multiple monitor setup** too.


And it can be launched from **Tools >> Page Explorer** or **Right click menu** on Tab controls or MultiFrame Structures.

More to come!
Until then, let's have some quality coding...
