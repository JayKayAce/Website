Full Description:
The TSVN Toolkit integrates Subversion into LabVIEW via the Project Explorer context menu and toolbar, File menu, Tools menu, and QuickDrop. Icon overlays display SVN status in Project Explorer similar to TortoiseSVN in Windows Explorer.

The included VI Dashboard tool extends LabVIEW functionality to include sorting and filtering of all VIs in memory and can perform SVN batch operations and others, such as changing settings on multiple VIs at once and opening FP and BDs.

LabVIEW **MUST** be restarted after installing or upgrading this package.

This package requires TortoiseSVN 1.8.x-1.10.x be installed prior to installation. TortoiseSVN can be downloaded from http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html
