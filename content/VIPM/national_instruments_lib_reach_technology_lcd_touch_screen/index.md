Full Description:
Reach Technology builds a wide range of color touch screen displays with an RS232 communication interface. This driver exposes the Reach embedded LCD commands within NI LabVIEW software. 

The API includes commands for drawing text, charts, shapes, buttons, bitmaps, and other user interface elements. To facilitate user interaction, the driver reports touch events, including X,Y tap coordinates; button presses; and slider control values. You can quickly build a custom embedded user interface to augment NI CompactRIO, NI Single-Board RIO, and other headless systems running LabVIEW. 

Install this driver by using VI Package Manager. Disable Mass Compile when you install this driver to LabVIEW 2010 or later. Complete the following steps to disable Mass Compile:
1. Open VI Package Manager.
2. Selects Tools'Options. Remove the checkmark from the Mass Compile VIs After Package Installation checkbox.
