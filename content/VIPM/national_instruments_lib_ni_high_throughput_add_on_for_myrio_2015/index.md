Full Description:
With the NI High Throughput Add-On for myRIO, you can create applications on the myRIO using the high-throughput FPGA personality. FPGA personalities consist of predefined FPGA bitfiles for you to program with your myRIO. The myRIO high-throughput FPGA personality supports high-speed analog (including audio) or digital data access. You can use the high-throughput personality for projects in need of waveform data.

**Note** Before installing the High Throughput Add-On for myRIO, you must install **LabVIEW**, the **LabVIEW Real-Time Module**, and the **LabVIEW myRIO Toolkit**. The High Throughput FPGA Personality VIs appear on the **myRIO** palette after you install the High Throughput Add-On for myRIO.
