Full Description:
SimonH:

Between the system controls defined by the operating system and the additional system-styled controls I posted here we have options for most LabVIEW controls.  The most notable missing elements were the special I/O controls that are more than simple ring controls (as they are able to self-populate based on what I/O is configured in the system).
 
I recently found out that we have created system-style DAQmx controls for internal use, they just aren't in the normal palettes.  I'll work on getting these on the default palettes in the future but for now you can just download the attached MNU file and you'll have the following new controls.
