Full Description:
This library allows for bi-directional communication over LabVIEW Network Streams in order to communicate with remote systems. You can specify the two endpoint names and one of the IP addresses. You can also communicate on the same computer by using 'localhost' as the address. Check out the examples for ideas on how to use the library.
