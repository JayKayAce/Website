Full Description:
The NI EDVR Input Stream Framework is a .lvclass and example template that can be used for high rate data streaming applications with instruments that are capable of utilizing the external data value reference data type.

The example combines the EDVR Input Stream .lvclass with basic TDMS file IO and efficient UI update mechanisms for monitoring the status and progress of an acquisition.

The EDVR Input Stream.lvclass is a simple abstraction layer that requires that most methods are overwritten by a child class.
