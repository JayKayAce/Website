Full Description:
LabSocket-Embedded ('LabSocket-E') enables remote access from desktop or mobile web browsers to LabVIEW applications operating on National Instruments Real-Time platforms such as CompactRIO, Single-Board RIO, myRIO and PXI devices, without browser plugins or a client run-time engine.  The Student and Home Edition is also compatible with Raspberry Pi devices.

The system generates HTML and JavaScript code representative of a Target VI front panel and synchronizes the VI front panel elements with those in the browser.

Requires LabVIEW 2014+ 32-bit for Windows.  VI Package Manager and LabVIEW must be run with Administrator rights during package installation.

LabSocket-E does **not** require the use of the LabSocket Server Virtual Machine.
