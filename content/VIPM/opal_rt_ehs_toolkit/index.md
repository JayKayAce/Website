Full Description:
**Note:** This installer requires VIPM to be run with Administrator privileges.  To do so, close VIPM & LabVIEW, right-click the VIPM shortcut, and select 'Run As Administrator'.

The eHS Solver is a generic and reprogrammable FPGA-based algorithm that enables a user to simulate circuits designed with SimScape Power System Simulink toolbox, PSIM, PLECS Blockset, or NI Multisim on FPGA with a sample time in the submicrosecond domain without needing to implement the mathematical equations. The eHS API provides access to VIs and controls that allow the OPAL-RT eHS solver to be implemented on NI FPGA targets. The API is composed of three main libraries: eHS Stream Generation, eHS Host, and eHS FPGA VIs.
