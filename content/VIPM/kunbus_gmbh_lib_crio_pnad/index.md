Full Description:
**PROFINET Device Interface for CompactRIO**  
forLabVIEW 2018 or later

**Required Software**
Before using this driver it is needed to install the following software components:
   - LabVIEW RT
   - FPGA
   - NI-RIO

**Help**
The Installation Instructions manual and the Getting Started manual can be found in *LabVIEW -> Help -> KUNBUS GmbH -> cRIO PNAD*.
Additionally the both manuals are included in the auto populating folder *Help* inside the PROFINET Device Example project.

**PROFINET GSDML File**
The cRIO PN Device's GSDML file can be found in the following folder: *...\\Public\\Documents\\Kunbus GmbH\\GSDML*. 
Additionally the GSDML file is included in the auto populating folder *GSDML* inside the PROFINET Device Example project.
The GSDML file is named *GSDML-Vx.x-Kunbus-cRIO PN-yyyymmdd.xml*

**PROFINET Device Example**
The sample project can be found in the NI Example Finder:  *LabVIEW -> Help -> Find Examples*.
Choose the directory *Toolkits and Modules -> Third-Party Add-Ons -> KUNBUS GmbH -> PROFINET*
Open the LabVIEW project *CS_cRIO-PN_IO-DeviceExample.lvproj*.
