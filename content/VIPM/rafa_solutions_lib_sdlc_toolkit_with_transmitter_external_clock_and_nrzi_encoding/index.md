Vendor: RAFA Solutions

Author(s): RAFA Solutions
 
Full Description:
SDLC Toolkit with NRZI encoding and transmitter external clock support for LabVIEW by RAFA Solutions easily implements and integrates Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) data communication protocol (developed by IBM) in custom applications. SDLC is equivalent to layer 2 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of network communication. 

The toolkit provides a LabVIEW FPGA Driver Library containing FPGA VIs, the SDLC TX (transmitter, with Host-to-Target and Target-Scoped FIFO options) and the SDLC RX (receiver, with Host-to-Target and Target-Scoped FIFO options), for data transmission and reception. Single or multichannel data communication can be implemented with additional drivers, as well as both VIs implement bit stuffing, unstuffing, CRC calculation, and forward error correction to eliminate the need for additional data processing.

The toolkit supports standard encoding (non-NRZI), as well as NRZ and NRZI line encoding methods.

Software and Hardware Requirements

- SDLC toolkit supports any FPGA enabled National Instruments hardware platforms and modules 
- SDLC toolkit requries LabVIEW 2018, LabVIEW FPGA 2018 and higher 

Note, VI Package Manager 2018 is required to install the package.
