Full Description:
This IP is designed to level the output of an RF power amplifier by iteratively measuring its output power and adjusting the supplied stimulus. These measurements and adjustments are performed continuously, as opposed to traditional techniques which make these measurements and adjustments in series, with significant latency between each. The parallel leveling in this IP is able to achieve much faster performance than traditional methods, placing the power amplifier into a known state so that subsequent measurements can be performed, decreasing overall test time.
