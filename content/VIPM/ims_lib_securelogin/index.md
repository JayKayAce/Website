Full Description:
Secure Login is a user authentication and management framework that allows you to easily implement highly secure user control for any project.  Fully featured login and management can be added by dropping in a single VI.  5 different visual themes are a great starting point for matching the style of your existing projects.  Build authentication deeply into your project with the user management VIs that are part of this framework.  A passphrase generator can be used to create easy to remember passwords from select combinations of user generated keywords.  Robust encryption is used with security measures throughout the authentication scheme.  For support, please contact support@imsysinc.com.  To purchase, please contact sales@imsysinc.com.
