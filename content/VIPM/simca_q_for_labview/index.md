Full Description:
SIMCA-Q for LabVIEW make use of the SIMCA-Q library to enable automated predictions in LabVIEW. Since Multivariate Data Analysis build empirical models based on historical data, a model has first to be created inside the off-line modelling tool SIMCA. The SIMCA-Q for LabVIEW interface can then do predictions through the model by applying new observations. The software will then transfer the calls into the validated product SIMCA-Q, which will in turn perform the actual mathematical calculations. For further information, please see the installed User Guide, or our web site (www.umetrics.com).
