Full Description:
Alphabetize Cluster Elements (ACE) is a Quick Drop Keyboard Shortcut (QDKS) and Shortcut Menu Plugin (SMP) that will alphabetize elements in a cluster. This is especially useful if the cluster, either a constant or a control, is arranged horizontally or vertically. Alphabetizing the elements provides a quick and easy way to organize elements in a cluster and increases project consistency. This also includes a relatively simple Application Programming Interface (API) toolkit to programmatically alphabetize cluster elements or include this functionality in other QDKS or SMPs.
