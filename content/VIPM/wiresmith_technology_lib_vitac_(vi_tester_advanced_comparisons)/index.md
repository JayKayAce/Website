Full Description:
VI Tester Advanced Comparisons (VITAC) provides some more advanced comparison VIs to support use of VI tester in unit testing.

If you are already using VI tester you can substitute some of the test VIs for these to get:

 - Comparisons not supported e.g. 1D arrays.
 - Better reporting e.g. where in a string is a failure.

It also adds templates to support common test cases and provide easier to read tests.
