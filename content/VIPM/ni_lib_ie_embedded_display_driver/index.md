Full Description:
This code library includes NI LabVIEW FPGA code for a communication engine to HD44780-based character LCDs. The driver supports APIs from both the LabVIEW Real-Time and LabVIEW FPGA modules to the communication engine. The HD44780 command set is common across the majority of character LCD modules. 

This driver uses field-programmable gate array (FPGA) digital I/O lines to communicate with LCD modules. Depending on the display bus width, the driver needs 8 or 12 FPGA digital I/O lines. NI Single-Board RIO, NI R Series multifunction reconfigurable I/O (RIO), and NI CompactRIO (with NI 9403 module) hardware work with this driver.
