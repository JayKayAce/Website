Full Description:
The DRAM interface on NI FPGA products is typically much wider than the data being processed.  In order to maximize DRAM throughput, incoming data should be matched to the interface width.  The NI BRAM Packetizer IP package provides a component for aggregating 32 bit samples and providing these samples to the 512 bit DRAM interface on NI FlexRIO devices.
