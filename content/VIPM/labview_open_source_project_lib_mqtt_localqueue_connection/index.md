Vendor: LabVIEW Open Source Project

Author(s): Francois Normandin
 
Full Description:
LV-MQTT-LocalQueue-Connection
https://github.com/LabVIEW-Open-Source/MQTT-Connection-LocalQueue

This package is an example for how to create a new specific connection package based on the abstract Connection class. The local queue implementation can be used for integration testing when a network connection is not available and when network functionality os not the goal of the test. It can also be used to provide inter-process communication in a way where the connection is injectable at runtime, thus making it possible to change the course of communication through a message-abstarction layer with little pain.
