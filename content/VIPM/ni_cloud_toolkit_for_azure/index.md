Full Description:
The NI Cloud Toolkit for Azure allows you to write LabVIEW code to interface with various Microsoft Azure Services. To learn more about Azure, visit http://azure.microsoft.com.

The initial release of the NI Cloud Toolkit for Azure includes support for the following Azure Services: Blob and Queue. However, the toolkit also includes a base class generic implementation for interfacing to any Azure Service. This means that you can install this toolkit, then write your own class to implement communication with Azure Services other than those included with the toolkit.
