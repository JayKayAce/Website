Full Description:
Provides a SerialStream implementation based on the IG Stream Base library. Uses VISA under the hood but is only intended for serial use, other connections may work but are not tested.

A demo serial terminal is provided demonstrating use of the library to read/write data to a serial port and allow a user to interact with the serial device.
