Vendor: JKI

Author(s): JKI
 
Full Description:
This package provides UI templates to get started with the JKI State Machine Objects (SMO) framework.

The JKI State Machine Objects for LabVIEW is an easy-to-use yet powerful object-oriented framework, based on the JKI State Machine. It is the very same framework that is used by the JKI team in our everyday project work, and is the result of years of refinement by our team of LabVIEW experts.
