Full Description:
Newton API for LabVIEW is a library of LabVIEW Virtual Instruments (VI) allowing control and monitoring of Newton controller from custom applications build in LabVIEW graphical programming environment.

Newton API for LabVIEW is intended for Newton Fatigue controllers, and includes the following VIs:

Open Connection
Close Connection
Set Connection Details
Get Connection Details
Configure
Get Firmware Info
Get Controller Name
 Get Machine Status
Get DIO Status
Set PID Parameters
Jog
Go to Home Position
Tare Sensor/Channel
Get Profile Parameters
Set Profile Parameters
Set GoToandHold Profile
Get System Status
Safety Control
Start Movement
Stop Movement
Set Safety Limits

The library is provided as VIPM (VI Package Manager) package, which can be installed on any computer with LabVIEW environment available. The API supports LabVIEW versions 2018 and higher.

Newton LabVIEW API operates in conjunction with Newton software, i.e. Newton software is used to deploy the firmware on the controller, configure machine, create tests, run test, perform offline analysis and generate reports, while VIs included into the API library allow to connect to the machine while it is running and configure safety features, set profile parameters, start/stop movement, jog, monitor status, etc.

For proper operation of the API Newton Controller and Newton software application are required. For more information about Newton Controller and software please check the product brochure https://www.testresources.net/media/pdf/newton-introductory-brochure.pdf

The Newton API for LabVIEW Standard Control Option Toolkit Supports Newton Software/Firmware version 7.5.3.

The toolkits requires LabVIEW, LabVIEW FPGA 2018 and higher.
