Full Description:
Developing heterogeneous distributed systems is a complex challenge. RTI DDS Toolkit for LabVIEW extends the benefits of RTI Connext solutions to LabVIEW applications. RTI Connext (TM) solutions provide a flexible data distribution infrastructure for integrating data sources of all types. At its core is the world's leading ultra-high performance, distributed networking data bus. It connects data within applications as well as across devices, systems and networks. RTI Connext is standards-based and an open architecture connecting devices from deeply embedded real-time platforms to enterprise servers across a variety of networks.


RTI DDS Toolkit for LabVIEW is built on the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard, the leading data-centric publish/subscribe (DCPS) messaging standard for integrating distributed real-time applications. The VI blocks in this toolkit allow you to easily publish and share data between multiple LabVIEW applications or between LabVIEW and non-LabVIEW applications. 

Features at a glance:
- Seamless integration between LabVIEW and other applications implemented in C, C++, Java, C#/.Net, and Ada
- Peer-to-peer data communication
- Dynamic peer discovery
- Substantially reduce application programming effort
- Many customizable Quality of Service parameters available for fine tuning application behavior without coding


The current version of RTI DDS Toolkit for LabVIEW is compatible with 32-bit versions of LabVIEW only. Review Release Notes for details on backward compatibility issues.
