Full Description:
Serial Wire Debug (SWD) is digital serial communication protocol. It provides a debug port for pin limited packages. 

SWD uses an ARM standard bi-directional wire protocol, defined in the ARM Debug Interface v5, to pass data to and from the debugger and the target system in a highly efficient and standard way.

SWD replaces the 5-pin JTAG port with a clock + single bi-directional data pin, providing all the normal JTAG debug and test functionality plus real-time access to system memory.

SWD Toolkit for LabVIEW provides library of VIs implementing:

- SWD Master Write
- SWD Master Read
- SWD Slave

The toolkit supports any FPGA enabled National Instruments hardware platforms.
The toolkit requires LabVIEW FPGA 2018 or higher.

Note, VI Package Manager 2018 or higher is required to install the toolkit.
