Full Description:
This tool allows users to easily create multiple timers for controlling the timing of their code, measuring or benchmarking.
New updated version of timer is using the Extensible Session Framework to allow the timers to be named and interfaced by name. This makes it much easier for the users comfortable with queues and notifiers to start using timers in the same way.
