Desription:
This toolkit is to be used in LabVIEW applications (both windows and real-time) for stopping parallel loops.
It allows to stop paralllel loops by one command in one of the loops. This toolkit can be used instead of other stopping mechanisms, which use FGV technics. The advantage of the parallel stop VI is that it is reentrant and the it stops the loops simultaneously, unlike the FGV which stops the loops in sequence (because of its nature of being non-reetrant).
