Full Description:
This VI represents an advanced face detector. It will find the location and pose of faces in an image with the help of deep learning algorithms.

In order to run fast it can use a CUDA-enabled GPU. However, it can also run only on CPU (with much slower speed).

The VI extracts the location of a face in the image and will return its rectangle. The pose information consists of 5 prominent features of the face (e.g. eye location, nose location).
In comparison to the OpenCV face detection example this detector provides superior detection performance.
