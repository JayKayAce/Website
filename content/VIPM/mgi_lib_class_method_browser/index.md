Vendor: MGI

Author(s): Moore Good Ideas, inc.
 
Full Description:
In visual studio (like many other IDEs) there is an extremely helpful auto complete functionality. When you're working with a class, you can just type a period, and the IDE will figure out what what methods you're allowed to call on that class. This is extremely helpful when working with classes that you're unfamiliar with.

The Class Method Browser brings this functionality to LabVIEW. Through a quick drop plugin you can select a wire, class constant, class control, or class subVI, and then view all the methods that are callable on that class. This takes into consideration access scope, and it finds all methods all the way up to the parent class. This saves time browsing through the project to find the method you're looking for.

Default Quickdrop Shortcut:  <Ctrl-Space> <Ctrl-C>
