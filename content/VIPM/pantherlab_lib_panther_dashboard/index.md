<size=20>**Hey, I'm Enrique and Coffee is more than just a drink for me, it's a fuel that keeps me going when I'm coding. I love to explore different flavors and roasts, and I enjoy sharing my passion with others. That's how I created this tool, where I implement what I need to do my work. If you find Panther Dashboard useful and want to support me, you can buy me a coffee through the link below. It would mean a lot to me and it will keep me motivated.  You can also give this project a star on vipm.

Thank you for your generosity and appreciation!
