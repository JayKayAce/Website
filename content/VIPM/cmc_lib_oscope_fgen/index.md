Full Description:
Oscilloscope & Function Generator for NI myRIO turns your computer and myRIO into a fully functional 2 Channel, 250kHz Oscilloscope and 2 Channel Function Generator. Use it for labs or for your own projects in order to study and understand signal behaviors.  Take measurements and view waveforms. Generate signals to test circuits or drive electronics. Explore and modify the code to add your own additional functionality. 

To run this app:
1. Open LabVIEW.
2. Select 'Create Project' from the Getting Started Window splash screen.
3. Select the myRIO category underneath Sample Projects.
4. Choose Oscilloscope & Function Generator for NI myRIO and complete the wizard to launch the project.
5. Open RT Main.vi and Desktop Main.vi
6. Run RT Main.vi. If necessary, complete FPGA compilation.
7. Run Desktop Main.vi
8. Connect AO0 or AO1 to AI0 or AI1 on Connector C of the NI myRIO.
9. Specify desired output values for Function Generator and click run.
9. Click Run in the Acquisition Settings
10. View the incoming signal and use the various controls to measure and visualize.

For best performance, use via USB connection.
