Full Description:
**JKI Package Manager 2017 or higher is required to install SP7**

**DATA AHEAD SP7**
With SP7 you can communicate with a Siemens PLC via an easy-to-use LabVIEW API – even in real time environments

- Multiple read and write functions 
- Access over Ethernet 
- No need for expensive OPC connections or complex Bus systems. 

Works with all ethernet equipped Siemens hardware PLCs: 
- S7-300 Series (e.g. the S7 312, 313, 314, 315, 317, 319 and all other variants in the series including the C, F and T-Models) 
- S7-400 Series (e.g. the S7 412, 414, 416, 417 and all other variants in the series including the F and H-Models) 
- S7-1200 Series (e.g. S7 1211, 1212, 1214, 1215, 1217 and all variants within the series) 
- S7-1500 Series (e.g. S7 1511, 1513, 1515, 1516, 1517, 1518 and all variants within the series including the C, F, R and T-Models) 
- LOGO! (e.g. the Logo 8 Modules and all other Logos in the series) 

- Works with many Siemens compatible PLCs like Vipa / YASKAWA. Please download the SP7 evaluation version to test the connection. 

You can evaluate SP7 for 30 days, after that a developer license can be purchased. 

Requirements:
SP7 requires LabVIEW 2011 or newer.
There are no specific OS requirements as SP7 only uses basic LabVIEW functions.

Support information:
A quick reference guide (which also explains the **activation** of the toolkit) can be found in ..\\National Instruments\\LabVIEW xx\\help\\DATA AHEAD GmbH\\SP7\\
