Full Description:
This IP provides blocks for generating uniform and AWGN noise types.  The underlying random number generation is achieved using linear feedback shifts registers, which are also exposed as 23, 31, and 32-bit PRBS generators.

The IP supports up to 256 combined instances of PRBS and Noise IP blocks.  The seeds are configured via the host.
