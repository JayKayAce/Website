Vendor: IlluminatedG

Full Description:
This example is a simple Stopwatch app that demonstrates WebSocket messaging and the ability to combine multiple stream types with a single messaging manager. This package combines IG WebSocket Stream, IG TCP Stream, IG Stream Messaging, and IG HTTP Utils packages to provide remote control and viewing capabilities of the timer functionality from both browser WebSocket based clients and LabVIEW TCP clients.

Once the package is installed, click on the Examples button in the package info to find the project file for the demo. In each of the classes there is a Main.vi in the Public virtual folder that can be run to start the corresponding part of the application; the Server must be running for clients to function. The Main.vi in the Client class can be run multiple times to spawn multiple LabVIEW clients.
