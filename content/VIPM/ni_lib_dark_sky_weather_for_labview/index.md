Vendor: National Instruments

Author(s): Matt Justiss
 
Full Description:
The Dark Sky API is one of the most powerful weather APIs available. This LabVIEW addon provides VIs to call the Dark Sky API and retrieve past, current, and predicted-future weather data for a given location. The example VIs also process the returned data and format it for use in LabVIEW applications.

Two high-level functions are available:
1. Dark Sky Forecast Request
This type of request is for current and predicted (in the future) data
More info at: https://darksky.net/dev/docs/forecast

2. Dark Sky Time Machine Request
This type of request is for observed (in the past), current, or predicted (in the future) data
More info at: https://darksky.net/dev/docs/time-machine

Note: the Dark Sky API requires a location, in longitude and latitude coordinates, in order to return data. This LabVIEW addon does not generate coordinates, and should be used alongside another method of retreiving coordinate data. Example VIs have pre-entered default values for demonstration and testing purposes.
