Full Description:
Network TClk Driver is network-working TClk driver i.e. the same niTClk driver, to which is added ability to work remotely with a PXI platform.That means you develope and run your VIs on your computer which is connected to the PXI platform. ** This provides also ability for multiple users to work with one PXI platform. **

NetTClk installes Driver Toolkit that works with NetTClk WebService. You should install NetTClk WebService on the PXI platform before working with NetTClk. NetTClk WebService is also available through VIPM.Once you have installed NetTClk on your computer, you can work with any PXI platform, on which is installed NetTClk WebService.
Toolkit VIs are located in the Functions Palette > Instrument Drivers > NetDrivers > NetTClk palette.

As NetTClk synchronizes multiple NetDrivers, it doesn't install any example, but if you choose to install NetTClk than you should have been already installed NetRFSA, NetRFSG or NetScope and you can find examples with NetTClk for that drivers.

Requires VIPM 2014 for installation.

Find NetTClk Documentation in LabVIEW Help Menu.
