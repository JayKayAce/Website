Vendor: Distrio

Author(s): Distrio
 
Full Description:
Murmex is Distrio's software framework for distributed input/output applications.

It allows to efficiently realize local and distributed cross-platform software applications for signal acquisition, generation and processing as well as sophisticated laboratory or industrial hardware control and monitoring systems.

**Component-based architecture**
Divide your software into independently testable components. Multiple software developers can implement these components in parallel, allowing you to speed up time-to-market. Murmex will make sure that the individual components seamlessly work together in the final application.

**Flexibility and extendability**
Components can be connected to data-processing pipelines and networks. You can realize a toolbox of components that can be assembled with combinatorial flexibility. Implement components to be flexibly configurable, thereby further extending the number of possible applications you can realize.

**Cross-platform support**
Murmex is available in different programming languages. For each component, you can select the most suitable programming language for implementation. Again, Murmex will make sure that the individual components seamlessly work together in the final application.

**Distributed applications**
Under the hood, Murmex uses a message-oriented middleware (RabbitMQ) to connect components across computers and platforms.

**Requirements**
LabVIEW 2014 or newer
JKI VIPM, 2014 or newer for installing the packages.
EasyXML, the demo version is automatically installed.
LabbitMQ, is automatically installed.
RabbitMQ server, currently only version 3.6.2 is supported. The server can be installed on any operating systems.
Erlang, version 19.0.
