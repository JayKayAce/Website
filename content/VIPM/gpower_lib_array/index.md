Vendor: GPower

Full Description:
The GPower Array toolset complements the built-in array functions, specifically;

- Remove specific elements from an array:
Remove all duplicates within an array, remove all instances of a specific element, or filter an array by a substring/regular expression or by a numeric range.

- Search array for multiple elements in one go:
Get all indices of a specific element within an array, or search for multiple different elements in one go.

- Replace array element with automatic resize:
Enhanced version of the built-in Replace Array Subset function, which automatically resizes the input array if you attempt to replace an element outside the original array boundary.

- Diff arrays:
Given two arrays, find equal or unequal elements between them, or split them into unique and common elements.

- Reorder an array by template:
Supply a template array as well as that template's reordered issue, then the subject array will be reordered like the template. Useful if you have a subject array of a data type that you can't simply sort somehow, but you are able to supply another equivalent array that you can sort (for instance extract a text field from a cluster and sort that, then use that sorted issue as a means to sort the original array of clusters).

- Create arrays:
Initialize an array with either a range of random or specific values.

- Pad arrays to even length.
