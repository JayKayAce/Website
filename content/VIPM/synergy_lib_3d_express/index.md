Full Description:
3D Express is a platform provided by Synergy. The user can create any simple or complicated 3 dimensional models easily with the use of 3D Express. The software also provides the user with LabVIEW 3D Express APIs, which makes it much more convenient to design 3D software.
The basic functions of 3D Express
1. It can be used to edit, display and control any form of 3D mechanical structures;
2. Provide 3D Express for NI LabVIEW toolkit. All the models designed can be seamlessly compatible with NI LabVIEW 3D picture control. Therefore, engineers who are engaged in mechatronics project can focus on signal acquisition, analysis and control, instead of spend a lot of time designing the 3D program;
3£®Provide simulation interface. The user can use NI LabVIEW, matlab, C\\C++ and other computer languages to finish a simulation or a test.
