Full Description:
The ColorSelector QControl is a QControl that inherits from and extends the Cluster Control. It contains in the cluster a picture control for the grayscale selector, a picture control for the color selector, numbers for red, blue, green, and hex representations of the color, and a color box showing the selected color. 

This toolkit comes with many other methods that convert color representations between RGB, RGB Hex, CMYK, HSL, HSV, and Greyscale Index.  It also includes common named colors in web design. Many of the conversion method can be used without having to use the QControl functionality.
