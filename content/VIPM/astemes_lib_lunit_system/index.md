- Test results visible directly in LabVIEW project explorer
- Instant loading of UI
- Parallel test execution managed by framework
- Dynamic test methods for testing of class hierarchies

LUnit is integrated into the LabVIEW development environment and the functionality is accessed through the Tools->LUnit menu. From the menu, you may create a new tests or open the LUnit UI to run tests.
