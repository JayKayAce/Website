Vendor: YEA Engineering

Author(s): YEA Engineering
 
Full Description:
'OTA Power Measurement Toolkit for CATR Method' is a set of functions that allow to perform Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), Total Radiated Power (TRP) and  Sensitivity Measurements in Over-the-Air (OTA) Test Setup using Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR) Method according to 3GPP 38.810 Specification. The Toolkit is designed to be used along RFmx SpecAn functions to convert Power Measurement values of RFmx to account for gains and losses due to Free Space, CATR Mirror, Probe Antenna and Cables in the OTA Test Setup.

System Requirements: 

Windows 7 or later operations system

NI LabVIEW 2016 or later

NI LabVIEW 2016 Run - Time Engine 64 bit

NI - RFmx SpecAn 3.0 or later

After installation of LabVIEW 2016 Run - Time Engine, you need to uninstall toolkit, if it installed, and install again.
