Full Description:
Touchscreen Keyboard by CPE Systems NZ is an easy-to-use tool to add touchscreen capability to LabVIEW applications. 

It is simple to add a Touchscreen Keyboard (Sliver Buttons) to new or existing applications; all it requires is initializing the keyboard at the beginning of the application and closing it at the end of the application. 

A numeric keyboard appears when touched/clicked on a numeric control while an alphanumeric keyboard appears for strings and paths. 
The position of the keyboard can selected to be under the control, under the window or the bottom centre of the monitor. 
The keyboard will align to be on the monitor. Control values can be updated on typing, on keyboard close or with user events. 
The keypad disappears after 10 seconds of inactivity, or if you click a different control, or click on the VI background.

Examples include Event Signalling, On a SubVI, On Two front panels, and numeric controls with range and cocerce support.

Numeric Keyboard size: 220 x 277 pixels.
Alpha Keyboard size: 1000 x 290 pixels. 

Value change property nodes are not supported. Use user events option if validation of entered data is required before the control value is used elsewhere in the program. 

Free to use in Runtime deployments.
