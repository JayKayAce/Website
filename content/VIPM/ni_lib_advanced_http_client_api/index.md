Full Description:
This API is intended to be a replacement for the HTTP Client API (Data Communication > Protocols > HTTP Client) that ships with LabVIEW. This new API includes multiple benefits over the existing LabVIEW API including:

1. Support for the PATCH verb.
2. Support for any arbitrary HTTP verb via a 'Generic Request' VI.
3. Better compatibility with newer HTTP versions.
4. Multithreading safe operations.
