Full Description:
The Python Integration Toolkit provides a seamless bridge between Python and LabVIEW.  With fast two-way communication between environments, your LabVIEW project can benefit from thousands of mature, well-tested software packages in the Python ecosystem.  

Quickly and efficiently access scientific and engineering tools for signal processing, machine learning, image analysis, data import/export, and more. With only minimal coding on the Python side, this extraordinarily simple interface provides access to all of Pythonâ€™s capabilities.

You can develop and test your code quickly with Enthought Canopy, a fully integrated development environment and supported Python distribution included with the Toolkit. The Python Integration Toolkit is also compatible with nearly all other Python distributions for Windows.

**Requires:** Python 2.7. A full Python distribution is included with the Toolkit; you are also free to use others.
