Full Description:
The LabVIEW GPU Analysis Toolkit provides VIs for offloading FFT and BLAS operations to a graphics processing unit (GPU) device. This functionality is useful in applications with computationally challenging problems. A GPU can compute large problems while the CPU continues to function as the primary processor. If you have a GPU device installed and it is accessible from the host processor, the GPU Analysis Toolkit allows you to manage the device and its resources from LabVIEW.
