Full Description:
This package contains a toolkit for calculation of photometric quantities from Spectral Power Distributions (SPDs) for inline instrument output or standalone applications. The package also includes ColorCreator, a fully featured Spectral Composition and analysis tool, that harnesses the toolkit. Spectral analyses include CIEXYZ, CIEUVW, CIELAB, CIELUV, CRI, CQS 7.5 & 9.0, and Luminous Efficacy.

Bin and ellipse test inclusion functions and examples are included for test data analysis. Graham Scan construction of convex hull and smallest ellipse algorithms are included to estimate data spread for dUV analysis of measured data. A library of geometric functions as employed in the algorithms is also included.

Plotting functions for isotherms, bins, MacAdam ellipses and all major plot types are included and demonstrated in examples.

The main application, Color Creator, comes packaged with a library of standard illuminants, stock spectra, and industry standards. It also makes available a collection of standard spectral shapes for design of theoretical spectra and the effects on calculated photometric quantities and rendering.

The suite of functions as employed in Color Creator calculates many photometric quantities from a Spectral Power distribution. Sample usage is demonstrated in the applications in the Examples folder. Commented block diagrams and comprehensive help is included. 

This package requires the Interface Innovations Shared Library available at http://interfaceinnovations.org/downloads.html.
