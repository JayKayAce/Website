Full Description:
NI License Manager (NILM) is NI's solution for protecting, licensing and activating software that is built on the NI Platform.  The NILM API for LabVIEW is part of the NILM Third Party SDK and is a toolkit for licensing LabVIEW applications that are sold through the LabVIEW Tools Network.  This enables customers to evaluate third party software before purchasing, and have a single evaluation and activation experience for all NI and Third Party products sold through ni.com.

The NILM API for LabVIEW supports licensing applications built in LabVIEW 2014 and later.  For licensing VI Libraries in LabVIEW, the recommended solution is the NI LabVIEW Third Party Licensing & Activation Toolkit (<u><color=blue>http://www.ni.com/licensingtoolkit</u></color>).  For licensing VI Libraries in LabVIEW NXG and APIs for other languages or please see <u><color=blue>http://www.ni.com/nilmsdk</u></color>.
