Vendor: National Instruments

Author(s): National Instruments
 
Full Description:
This IP provides functionality for performing various math functions on indexed waveforms.

Max Hold, Min Hold, Average, and Squared Average blocks are provided.  These blocks are intended to be coupled with the NI Power Spectrum IP and NI Log IP, but other are suitable for other applications as well.

The default waveform length is 1024, but this can be adjusted by changing the size of the LabVIEW FPGA Memories within the library VIs.
