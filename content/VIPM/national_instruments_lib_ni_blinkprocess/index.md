Vendor: National Instruments

Author(s): National Instruments
 
Full Description:
This process controls the blink behavior of the USER1 LED on the front panel of a CompactRIO controller.

Actions Performed
Defines and implements the default behavior of the USER LED: blinking at a rate of once every two seconds after the device starts up. 
Implements custom LED behavior that other processes request, such as blinking twice per second when a process returns an unhandled error and the device enters Safe Mode.
