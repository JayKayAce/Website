Full Description:
This package of VI's for National Instruments LabView permits measuring time with a resolution of microseconds.

These VI's are useful for evaluating the efficiency of your code (benchmarking), and for controlling execution with microsecond resolution in non-deterministic systems, while allowing to implement  control algorithms in which the time is critical.

can make proportional to time, some actions as:
-  proportional constants.
-  integral and differential loops.
-  loops of execution. 
etc.....
