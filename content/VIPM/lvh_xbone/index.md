Full Description:
The MakerHub Interface for the Xbox One Controller makes it easy to read all button and axis data from an Xbox One Controller. Start by simply polling the controller using LabVIEW's standard open, read, close paradigm. More complex applications can take advantage of the build in support for buttons state change events.
