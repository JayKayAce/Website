The Bauer Station SDK is designed to take your data and format it so that it works in the Bauer Production Server (BPS) database.

The SDK allows you to easily build test results from your data and send it to BPS.

The Bauer Station SDK is written in C# using .Net Framework. As such, any .Net programming platform can be used such as C#, VB.Net, and LabView.
-	.Net version 4.7.2
