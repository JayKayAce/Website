Full Description:
Base library for stream based operations and abstract base classes for managing connections that provide data streams. To make file and in-place operations possible this library does provide concrete implementations for File Streams and String Streams that can be leveraged by various communication, logging, and serialization libraries.

As this is 90% an abstract base library there are no examples demonstrating its use. Each class is documented on its intended usage and dependant libraries will provide examples of usage in their context such as the client/server chat applications in *IG TCP Stream* and *IG Simple Msg*.
