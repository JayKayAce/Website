Full Description:
This version contains Windows 32bit and Windows 64bit version of m4LabVIEW 

m4LabVIEW library adds selected functionality from FFmpeg project to LabVIEW.

This library allows you to do following tasks using LabVIEW:

**read and write** most media formats including widely used containers like matroska, 3gp, ogg and many others;

**decode into IMAQ images** from file streams using most codecs including most common ones, like h265, h264, mpeg4 or mpeg2 and many others without the need to install them separately into operating system;

**encode IMAQ Images** into file streams using LGPLv2.1 encoders like mpeg2, mpeg4, h263p or Huffyuf and others. The library architecture also allows to replace the FFmpeg DLLs and use nonfree encoders like h265 or h264;

**read network streams from IP cameras** using FFmpeg supported protocols and codecs (probably all of IP cameras) and decode such streams into IMAQ images and/or mux them into file.

The library automatically converts the IMAQ image 32-bit rgb format into the one, the encoder supports and vice versa for decoders. Library also containes VIs to give you various information about files, network streams, codecs or media packets. 

**Requirements**

JKI VI Package Manager 2014 or higher
Windows 7 or higher
LabVIEW 2012 32-bit or higher
NI Vision Acquisition Software (Included with all NI vision hardware and NI vision software licenses)

**Pricing**

Developer license **949** USD
Runtime license **19** USD
