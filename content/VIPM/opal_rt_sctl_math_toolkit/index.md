Full Description:
The OPAL-RT SCTL Math Toolkit contains FPGA VIs that are designed to perform mathematical operations at very high execution rates up to 200MHz in single-cycle timed loops. The VIs include input and output handshaking signals to help developers synchronize the mathematics with the rest of their FPGA logic.
