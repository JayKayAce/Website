Full Description:
The NI Waveform Match Trigger IP provides a LabVIEW FPGA block for identifying and isolating an analog waveform by its shape.  This triggering method provides more selectivity than other methods, such as rising or falling edge triggers, and therefore increases the success and efficiency of isolating anomalous and infrequent signals.
