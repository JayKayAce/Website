Full Description:
This app runs on the NI myRIO-1900 target. The **Vocal remover for NI myRIO**  is a very simple audio processing demo that runs entirely on the FPGA. This sample project processes stereo audio data from the myRIO audio input, optionally removes the vocal track, and sends the remaining soundtracks to the audio output. This can be useful for a karaoke machine where the participant wants to substitute their own vocals.

NOTE: package requires **VIPM 2014** to be installed

**To run this app:**

1. Open LabVIEW
2. Select 'Create Project' from the getting started window.
3.Select the myRIO category underneath Sample Projects
4.Chose myRIO voice remover and complete the wizard to launch the project.
5. Open and run 'RT Main.vi'
