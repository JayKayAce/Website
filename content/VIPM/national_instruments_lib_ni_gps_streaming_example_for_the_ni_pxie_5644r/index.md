Full Description:
With more than 800 MB/s of PXI Express bandwidth, the NI PXIe-5644R can sustain continuous generation for signals occupying its full 80 MHz of real-time RF bandwidth. When combined with the real-time CPU-based waveform syntehsis of the NI GPS Simulation Toolkit, this example enables simulation of up to 12 satellites with custom power levels, Doppler shifts, and receiver motion trajectories.
