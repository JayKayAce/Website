Vendor: ImagingLab

Author(s): ImagingLab
 
Full Description:
With this library you can program a single LabVIEW application that integrates all aspects of machine control and automation simulation from part handling and robot control to advanced path generation and collision detection. Using this approach, you can easily use LabVIEW environment to simulate your robot application, which means you can achieve higher performance from your simulation in less time.

***IMPORTANT INFORMATION***
Please run VIPM as Administrator in order to install this library properly.

**Development environment requirements:**
- NI LabVIEW 2009 or later
- Visual Components 3DCreate 2012 SP2 (http://www.visualcomponents.com/)
- NI LabVIEW Run-Time Engine 2009 SP1
