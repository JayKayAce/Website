Full Description:
Vector Graph Toolkit allows you to draw 2D vectors in graph plotter and to do math operations with vectors.
Toolkit has one control: Vector graph with its properties, and functions working with graph data.
Each vector represented as a cluster including 2 parameters: polar coordinates (radial coordinate and angular coordinate) and start position (x, y).
Data of the Vector graph are presented as an array of the vectors. 
After installation the user can find this tool in the Add-Ons palette.
Included example demonstrates all aspects of the implementation

Release Notes:
Software requirements:
- VI Package Manager 2016 is required to install the package.
- LabVIEW 2016 or higher.
