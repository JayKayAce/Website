Full Description:
ZigBee is a specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols used to create personal area networks built from small, low-power digital radios. ZigBee is based on IEEE 802.15.4 standard. ZigBee operates in the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands: 2.4 GHz in most jurisdictions worldwide; 784 MHz in China, 868 MHz in Europe and 915 MHz in the USA and Australia. Data rates vary from 20 kbit/s (868 MHz band) to 250 kbit/s (2.4 GHz band). 

MaxEye Technologies provides generation and analysis functions in LabVIEW for generating and analyzing the ZigBee standard complaint signals using National Instruments Vector Signal Generators (NI VSG) and Vector Signal Analyzers (NI VSA) or Vector Signal Transceivers (NI VST). The IEEE 802.15.4 Standard supports multiple Physical Layer modes; the current version of the toolkits supports the following physical layer modes.

i.	OQPSK Physical Layer (2.4GHz)

ii.	BPSK Physical Layer (868/915 MHz)

Note: VI Package Manager 2014 is required to install the package, before installing the package run LabVIEW as administrator.
