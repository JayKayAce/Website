Full Description:
**This toolkit installer requires VI Package Manager 2014 or later to install.**

State-Machine based block-diagram design utilizing highly optimized & automated **Pebbles UI State Machine Controller**.

**Create a new (blank) VI** from a template under LabVIEW Menu **File->New...** or create a new project using **File->Create Project...**,  and follow the instructions on it for configuration.

Since this design utilizes enum-based states, it has low overhead and high-performance while preventing many user-errors encountered in string-based state machine designs. This design is also provides automated state-transitions based on user-defined configuration including user-specified states automatically called at specified invervals.
