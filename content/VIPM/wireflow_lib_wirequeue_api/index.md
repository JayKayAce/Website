Full Description:
Please note that this package requires **VIPM 2014 or later** for installation and requires VIPM to be run with **'administrator'** rights. To do this, close LabVIEW and VIPM, then start VIPM by right-clicking and select 'Run as administrator'

This is the driver for the WireFlow WireQueue MQTT product, a lightweight system to communicate between LabVIEW targets and other devices using MQTT with TLS support. It supports connection to any MQTT broker (MQTT 3.1.1).

To add specific topic handling, override methods in the MQTT_Overrides class.
