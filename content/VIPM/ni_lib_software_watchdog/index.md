Full Description:
This library implements a software watchdog.  The purpose of the watchdog is to guarantee that software processes are running as expected and are responsive.  The software watchdog can check multiple processes (loops) each with a different timeout.  On embedded system, it is recommended to use the software watchdog along with a hardware watchdog.
