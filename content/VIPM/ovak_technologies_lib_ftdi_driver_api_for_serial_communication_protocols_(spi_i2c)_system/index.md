Full Description:
The API provides high-level building block to communicate with FTDI Multi-Protocol Synchronous Serial Engine (MPSSE) based on D2XX driver and LibFT4222 library. The API enables users to write applications and communicate with the FTDI Chip's MPSSE enabled devices without needing to understand the low level D2XX driver and its command sets. MPSSE provides a flexible means of interfacing synchronous serial devices to a USB port.
