Vendor: GPower

Author(s): Steen Schmidt
 
Full Description:
The GPower Overflow toolset adds a set of functions that lets you do numeric operations while verifying the exactness of them, specifically;

- Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, negate, multiply, power, sum, product, and absolute value) that outputs an **Overflow?** Boolean.

- A set of conversion bullets, like the built-in ones, except these also output an **Overflow?** and an **Exact conversion?** Boolean.

All these functions saturate if overflow occurs.
