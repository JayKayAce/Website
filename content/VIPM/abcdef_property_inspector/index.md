Author(s): Michael Munroe
 
Full Description:
The **Property Inspector** Utility reads your project and allows filtering, searching, sorting and batch editing of VI properties including Description, Data Size, Reentrancy, In memory and Allow Debugging.  Filter the results by **20 object types**. Search items based on **44 properties and 11 criteria with compound searches**. Use **Global Exclusion™** to search out tagged items.  Specify one of **5 edit criteria and batch edit 23 properties** of hundreds of VIs.  **Persistent Selection™** keeps items highlighted when filtering, searching and sorting.  **Static Selection™** keeps highlighted items visible in the window when searching and sorting.  Keeps a history of the last 9 searches and a custom list of your 12 Favorite compound searches.

Additionally, VIs can be sorted by VI metrics to analyze the entire project for issues that would be very hard to find.  The resulting list can be exported for further analysis.  

Quickly show dozens of block diagrams and close them all in a single click.  Alternately open the first clones and set the Retain Wire Values always on.  Arrange just the block diagrams using cascade, tile and stack options.  Intelligent refresh  automatically updates VI objects in the background.

Multiple selections can be highlighted in the Project Explorer window or reverse selected.  Easily select all open windows.  Perform a search of just selected objects and select them again separately.  Select blocks of items by Group Size and easily select the next group.  Revert back to the previous selection at any time.

Use **VI Scripting or Quick Drop plugins** to add unlimited custom search and edit operations to multiple objects quickly.  A history allows repeating the last 9 of each script.  Delete multiple items from the project and the disk and delete all orphan items below the project folder.

This version supports multiple targets including cRIO and FPGA.

Both LabVIEW and VIPM must be running as administrator to install this utility.
