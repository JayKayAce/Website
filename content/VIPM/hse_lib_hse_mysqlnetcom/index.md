Full Description:
An open-source MySQL/MariaDB driver for LabVIEW using pure TCP/IP primitives. The original source code was developed by Marc Christenson and shared on NI's Example Program Code Exchange forum (link in the readme).

This is a reference implementation that has NOT been vetted for a production setting. It might or might not meet traditional requirements in terms of uptime, security, absence of bugs, etc. Use at your own risk!
