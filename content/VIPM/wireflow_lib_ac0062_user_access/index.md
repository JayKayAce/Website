Full Description:
**Please note that <u>VIPM 2014</u> is required for installation.** 

This is a user access toolkit that allows user access control using one of the authentication methods;
* Login dialogs
* WF USB dongles (e.g. using the USB dongle WF2008)
* WF Fingerprint reader (e.g. using the fingerprint reader WF2111)

** Please note that if any other authentication than 'Login dialogs' is to be used, additional hardware is required (e.g. WF2111 and/or WF2007).

Also note that Third Party Licensing & Activation Toolkit must be installed prior to this toolkit, in order to get the toolkit correctly registered and licensed.
If the installation fails, please try to run VIPM/LabVIEW with administrative rights**
