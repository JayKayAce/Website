Overview:

This QuickDrop PlugIn allows the fast and clean arrangement of Fornt Panel elements.

Controls that are not connected are listed under Locals.

The grid used can be customized in the ZAlign.ini file in the installation directory.
(C:\\Program Files (x86)\\National Instruments\\LabVIEW 20XX\\resource\\dialog\\QuickDrop\\plugins\\ZAlign)

There is also an extended mode for GUI front panels (see HowTo).


How to Use:
*******
On a front panel all controls are automatically arranged and the window size is adjusted. 
Key commands to run ZAlign:
1) CTRL-Space (start QuickDrop)
2) Run CTRL-A ZAlign

There is also the extended mode for GUI front panels. In this case the elements must be selected which 
should be aligned. The controls are then arranged in the upper left quadrant. Everything else remains
unchanged at its position.
