Vendor: SAS Workshops

Author(s): Sam Taggart
 
Full Description:
An autoformatter for LabVIEW inspired by Python's Black, LabVIEW's own Nattify and Felipe Silva's experiments.

It is run as a G-CLI Tool.

In it's simplest form:

g-cli blue -- 'Directory to Format'

It will find all VIs in the directory and run a set of autoformatting steps on them, similar to the Nattify Steps (in fact in the beginning exactly the Nattify, hopefully to be expanded in the future.)
