** Description **
Simulate your motional system with ACROME Stewart Platform! Roughness of any surface can be simulated with ACROME Stewart Platform. Stewart Platform is a high precision robotic structure by using six actuators. Stewart Platform has six degree of freedom from consist of three linear (x,y,z) and three rotational (roll, pitch, yaw) motions. The mechanism of the Stewart Platform could be integrated to various kind of system such as flight simulator, motion simulator, robocrane, radio
telescope, surgery application. Realize robotic applications on ACROME Stewart Platform with its perfect mechanical design and easy software interface.
