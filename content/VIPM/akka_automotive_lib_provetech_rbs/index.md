**NOTE - Usage on Real-Time system:**
Installation
1. Start VIPM and LabVIEW both as Administrator
2. Install .vip
3. Copy 'C:\\Program Files\\National Instruments\\RT Feeds\\provetechrbs-api_x.x.x.x_x64.ipk' to '/home/admin' on RT system using SFTP tool
4. Make sure RT target is connected to internet
5. SSH into target, run: opkg install provetechrbs-api_x.x.x.x_x64.ipk
6. Reboot RT target
7. For NI real-time targets an additional license is used.
   a. Run  *Examples\\Signals Single Point CAN.vi* in a new real-time project. This will create ''/tmp/\\<target name>.seed'. 
   b. Obtain a valid license key file by emailing your RBS serial number, the desired modules (CAN, LIN, FlexRay, Ethernet) and the file '/tmp/\\<target name>.seed' to provetech-rbs@akka.eu.
   c. Copy a valid *.key file to '/home/admin'. 
   d. Run example again.
