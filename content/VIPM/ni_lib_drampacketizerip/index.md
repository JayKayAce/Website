Full Description:
Some data transmission protocols, such as VITA49, require that each data packet contain only samples from one channel.  However, many multi-channel FPGA IP components process data in an interleaved manner.  This motivates the development of an IP component that is capable of receiving interleaved multi-channel data and transmitting packetized data.  Due to its high throughput and large size, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) is used to solve this problem.
