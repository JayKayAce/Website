Full Description:
The LabVIEW Statechart Module provides a programming model that you can use to design applications at a higher level than was previously possible. With the LabVIEW Statechart Module, you can develop statechart diagrams, define behaviors with LabVIEW dataflow programming, and deploy the statecharts to desktop PCs, real-time controllers, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and embedded targets.

Statecharts expand the classic state diagram with the additional features of hierarchy, concurrency, and comprehensive actions.

LabVIEW statecharts are especially useful for programming event-response applications such as intricate user interfaces and advanced state machines used to implement dynamic system controllers, machine control logic, and digital communication protocols.
