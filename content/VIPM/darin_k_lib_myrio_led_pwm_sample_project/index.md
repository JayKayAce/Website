Vendor: Darin.K

Author(s): Darin Kinion
 
Full Description:
This project works on the myRIO 1900 and should compile directly on the myRIO 1950 (requires FPGA module).  All of the functionality of the default FPGA personality is included and additional functions are added to control the brightness of the onboard LEDs.

To run:

1.  Open LabVIEW
2.  Select 'Create Project' from the Getting Started Window splash screen
3.  Select the myRIO category underneath Sample Projects
4.  Choose the LED PWM Sample Project and complete the Wizard to launch the project
5.  Open RT Main.vi and press Run
6.  View the LEDs on the myRIO, they should be fading in and out
7.  Press the stop button on RT Main.vi
8.  Modify RT Main.vi as needed to add your own functionality
