Full Description:
<u>What is it?</u>
Magic Connector Linker is a little LabVIEW add-on that speeds up arduous process of building connector pane.
Replace all precise clicks necessary to do this properly ('This connection is...') with just a few clicks.

Additionally you will get:
1. Nicely looking front panels of your subVIs
2. Gentle push towards few good programming practices like using 4-2-2-4 connectors or documenting default values of optional controls

<u>How to use it?</u>
1. Drop big pattern of a connector pane onto the front panel
2. Place your controls on the pattern
3. Click 'Connect controls'

<u>Installation notes</u>
After installation restart LabVIEW to refresh menus and/or palettes.
