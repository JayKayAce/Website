Full Description:
This IP emulates an over-the-air (OTA) channel for a wireless communication link.  By combining floating point host code and fixed point FPGA code, the channel emulator provides flexible channel profiles and models that can be easily added to and/or modified. It provides two custom channel profiles which are deterministic and stochastic with multiple input multiple output (MIMO) configurations.
