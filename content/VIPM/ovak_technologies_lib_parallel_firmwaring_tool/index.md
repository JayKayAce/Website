Full Description:
The Parallel Firmwaring Tool solves the problem of parallel imaging of National Instruments Real-Time controllers both on VxWorks and NI Linux-RT Operating systems.
Parallel firmwaring means that the duration of process of applying firmware to multiple devices will mainly depend on the network speed and firmware size and minimally depend on the number of controllers.
System requirements
     LabVIEW Base, Full or Professional Development system
     LabVIEW Real-Time Module
     NI CompactRIO Device Drivers
