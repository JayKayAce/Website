Full Description:
FPGA Add-on for DEEP LEATRNONG TOOLKIT is a Convolutional Neural Network Accelerator designed to deploy and accelerate pretrained CNNs on FPGA targets. The advantage of the accelerator is the flexibility of FPGAs, which enables the implementation of low precision CNN accelerators with maximal performance and power efficiency. It employs 8-bit precision for storing the activations and weights, and is capable to achieve similar performance as single precision floating point format.
