Full Description:
The toolkit allows the users to import .hdf format gravitational wave data. GraviFetch can decode .hdf format and read out all neccessary information, which has been compressed in the .hdf file. LabView interface allows management of these data and enables signal processing and further mathematical, physical operations with the read data. Example VI is provided to showcase the abilities of GraviFetch.
