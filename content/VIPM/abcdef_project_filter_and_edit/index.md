Full Description:
The Project Filter and Edit Tool allows batch editing of several VI properites including VI Description and Allow Debugging.  By selecting a filter based on 20 criteria, a subset of VIs can be identified, then selected in the results window.  Specify an edit criteria and apply to all the selected VIs.

Additionally, VIs can be filtered by VI metrics to analyze the entire project for issues that would be very hard to find.  The resulting list can be exported for further analysis.
