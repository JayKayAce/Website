Full Description:
LINX provides easy to use VIs for controlling common embeddded platforms like Arduino and chipKIT and enables developers to deploy LabVIEW applications to run on BeagleBone Black, Raspberry Pi and myRIO. Use the built in sensor VIs to acquire data in seconds or use the peripheral VIs to access the devices digital I/O, analog I/O, SPI, I2C, UART, PWM and more.
