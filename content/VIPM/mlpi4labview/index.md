Full Description:
The MLPI (Motion Logic Programming Interface) is a programming interface for high level programming languages (C/C++/C#/Java/LabVIEW/..). It can be used to write applications to configure and run a Bosch Rexroth controller which supports the MLPI interface technology, like IndraMotion XLC/MLC 13VRS and newer.

This mlpi4LabVIEW toolbox as a part of the MLPI adds a new palette to your National Instruments LabVIEW environment. Each MLPI function call is provided as a LabVIEW VI which can be integrated in your own LabVIEW program. Applications which are using the mlpi4LabVIEW toolbox can only run on Microsoft Windows operating systems or on a National Instruments cRIO 906x / 903x and needs a National Instruments LabVIEW installation. Please note that LabVIEW itself is not a product of Bosch Rexroth AG and a registered trademark of National Instruments. For further information see National Instruments LabVIEW Homepage (http://www.ni.com/labview). Please have a look at the mlpi4LabVIEW documentation for detailed information.
