Vendor: Initial State by Tektronix

Author(s): Initial State by Tektronix
 
Full Description:
Quickly stream and monitor data in your Initial State account from LabVIEW. Initial State is a cloud-based data streaming platform for the IIoT that can scalably receive data from any connected device through a simple HTTP REST API. This toolkit wraps that API in a simple-to-use LabVIEW palette. With a single VI, you can stream data from anywhere in your LabVIEW system and automatically get browser-based visualization, transformation, alarming, secure sharing, and comparison. You can also use the provided LabVIEW standard 'open-do-close' API for further optimization.

**Prerequisites and HW/SW Requirements:**
- You will need an account with Initial State to exercise this functionality. Sign up for free at www.intialstate.com
- If you are new to Initial State, it is a good idea to understand the platform outside the LabVIEW context. Go through our getting started guide to quickly familiarized yourself. 
- You will need to run this on a system with internet access. 
- This toolkit is verified on Windows 10, but will likely run on MacOS, Linux, and LabVIEW Real Time as it uses cross-platform LabVIEW code where possible.  
- To successfully run the 'Looping' LabVIEW example, you will need a valid Access Key from your Initial State account. (How-to is in getting started guide)
- To successfully run the 'One-shot' LabVIEW example, you will need a valid Access Key and Bucket Key from your Initial State account.
