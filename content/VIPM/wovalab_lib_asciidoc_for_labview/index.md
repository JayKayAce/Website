= What is AsciiDoc ?

AsciiDoc is two things:

. A mature, plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages, and more.

. A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various formats (called backends), including HTML, DocBook, PDF, and ePub.
