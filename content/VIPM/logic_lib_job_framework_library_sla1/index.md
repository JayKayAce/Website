Full Description:
The JOb Framework Library (JOb) provides a platform for rapid object-oriented development of general Windows applications. It structures the application design into a collection of actions, which can be combined to handle application use cases.

Specifically it:

- Encourages modular and consistent software designs, across developers and projects:

By enforcing streamlined inheritance structure and providing the signature requirement of functional blocks. JOb is specifically designed to encourage the developer to follow the SOLID design principles.


- Provides simple handles for executing functional blocks, in sequence and/or in parallel:

By abstracting complex implementations and exposing them as simple handles. Management of instantiated threads include, automatic handling of shutdown and clean-up, and easy thread delegation. 


- Provides global data management:

By maintaining a centralized, globally accessible register, that can address any data, for fast retrievel anywhere, and across threads.


- Provides centralized debug and event log handling:

By implementing a standard Windows debug output.


- Provides automatic handle of shutdown and clean-up routines.

By allowing registration of sequenced or parallel execution of actions, to be automatically executed upon application exit.


- And much more...
