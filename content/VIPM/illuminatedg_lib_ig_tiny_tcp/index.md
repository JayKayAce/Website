Full Description:
Tiny TCP is a minimal library for performing point-to-point TCP messaging. That means you can send multiple data types through a single connection with different messages identified by a message ID string. This is similar to NI's STM library. In addition to the message management done by STM, this library also handles the TCP connection management and also makes it easy to enable TLS encryption.
