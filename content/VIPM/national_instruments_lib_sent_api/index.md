Full Description:
The SENT driver API provides the NI LabVIEW FPGA code for the Single Edge Nibble Transmission (SENT) protocol communication engine. You can use this driver to communicate with SENT transmitters as SENT receiver when you connect SENT transmitters to hardware with field-programmable gate array (FPGA) digital I/O lines. This driver works with the NI Single-Board RIO and the NI CompactRIO 940x module hardware. 

Note: You must use JKI VI Package Manager to install this driver. Select Tools>>Options to disable the Mass Compile VIs After Package Installation option in the VI Package Manager before you install this driver for LabVIEW 2010 or later.
