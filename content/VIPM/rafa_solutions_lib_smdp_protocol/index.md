Sycon Multi Drop Protocol (SMDP) Toolkit is a library of VIs for data communication between Master and Slave devices using the SMDP protocol.

The toolkit supports Sycon Multi Drop Protocol versions 2 and 3.

SMDP Protocol LabVIEW library contains the following VIs:

Open Port - Initializes and configures serial port 
Close Port - Closes session for the specified serial port 
Master Read - Reads data from the slave device (used for the device in Master mode) 
Master Read Serialized - Reads serialized data from the slave device (used for the device in Master mode) 
Master Write - Writes the data to the device specified (used for the device in Master mode) 
Master Write Serialized - Writes the serialized data to the device specified (used for the device in Master mode) 
Slave Read - Reads data from the device (used for the device in Slave mode) 
Slave Read Serialized - Reads serialized data from the device (used for the device in Slave mode) 
Slave Write - Writes the data to the device specified (used for the device in Slave mode) 
Slave Write Serialized - Writes the serialized data to the device specified (used for the device in Slave mode)
