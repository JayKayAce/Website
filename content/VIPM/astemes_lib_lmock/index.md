Full Description:
LMock is a mocking framework used for automatically generating and maintaining mock classes. 

A mock is a test double used, in place of a concrete implementation, when writing automated tests. This enables testing units of code in isolation, as the interface to the rest of the system is 'mocked'. Using a mock the behavior of the code under test can be verified, by checking that the expected VI calls are made. Furthermore, outputs from calls to the mocked objects can be predefined to stimulate and control the system under test. 

The LMock toolkit features an expressive API, powerful scripting features, and detailed failure descriptions.
