Full Description:
The G# Framework is a free, award winning add-on toolkit for LabVIEW that adds reference based object-oriented support. It takes advantage of the data value reference structure  (dvr) together with the native classes and will add a full object-oriented support with excellent performance. This is the new generation of object-oriented support that makes LabVIEW as powerful as any object-oriented language. The G# Framework is a National Instrument Compatible with LabVIEW Gold product and was awarded 'Add-On of the Year for Community' at NI Week 2011.

**NB!** LabVIEW must be restarted to load the features that are integrated into the LabVIEW development environment, such as the right-click menu in the project explorer.
