** Description **
Realize control theory with ACROME Ball and Beam! Controlling the position of a ball on a beam is one of the conventional problems of the control theory. Ball and Beam plant can be used for a wide range of control system design implementations from basic linear controllers to advance nonlinear methods. Students are able to understand system design approaches with learn-by-doing methodology. They can distinguish effects of linearization, assumptions and modeling errors due to the differences between simulations and real world experiments, all can be seen at the same time.
