Full Description:
The DQMH project template is based on the NI Queued Message Handler Project Template (NI QMH). The DQMH project template improves on the NI QMH by providing safe, event-based message handling and scripting tools to make development easy, encourage same style between different developers in the same project and improve efficiency. 

DQMH modules are best used in applications where there needs to be multiple modules running in parallel that communicate with each other. 

DQMH modules can also be used for applications that have a single module, where the developer would benefit from having an API Tester has the capability of eavesdropping on the different DQMH events and messages.

This package includes the Queue and Admin classes used by the DQMH modules.
