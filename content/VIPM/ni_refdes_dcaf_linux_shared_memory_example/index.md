Full Description:
This LabVIEW Real-Time (RT) application, based on the Distributed Control and Automation Framework (DCAF), uses NI Scan Engine on NI CompactRIO (cRIO) for scanned hardware I/O data access, and provides access to the data by creating Linux shared memory as the interface to other processes. The LabVIEW RT application is based on DCAF, and implements a semaphore Linux IPC mechanism as a timing signal to enable synchronous execution of a complimenting example C application. The C example and LabVIEW RT applicationl run in parallel, sharing data between them on the NI Linux RT cRIO target.

Supported Hardware:
NI cRIO-906x, cRIO-903x.
