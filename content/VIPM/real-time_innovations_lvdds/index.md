Full Description:
Developing heterogeneous distributed systems is a complex challenge. RTI DDS Toolkit extends the benefits of RTI Connext solutions to LabVIEW applications. RTI Connext (TM) solutions provide a flexible data distribution infrastructure for integrating data sources of all types. At its core is the world's leading ultra-high performance, distributed networking data bus. It connects data within applications as well as across devices, systems and networks. RTI Connext is standards-based and an open architecture connecting devices from deeply embedded real-time platforms to enterprise servers across a variety of networks.


RTI DDS Toolkit is built on the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard, the leading data-centric publish/subscribe (DCPS) messaging standard for integrating distributed real-time applications. The VI blocks in this toolkit allow you to easily publish and share data between multiple LabVIEW applications or between LabVIEW and non-LabVIEW applications. 

Features at a glance:
- Seamless integration between LabVIEW and other applications implemented in C, C++, Java, C#/.Net, and Ada
- Peer-to-peer data communication
- Dynamic peer discovery
- Substantially reduce application programming effort
- Many customizable Quality of Service parameters available for fine tuning application behavior without coding


The current version of RTI DDS Toolkit is compatible with 32 and 64 bits version of LabVIEW for Windows as well as RT targets (cRIO) running NI Linux® Real-Time (only when installing LabVIEW 32bits). Review Release Notes for details on backward compatibility issues.

The installation of the RTI DDS Toolkit requires to run VIPM and/or LabVIEW with administrator privileges.
