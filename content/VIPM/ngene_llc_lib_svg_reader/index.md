Full Description:
This toolkit provides means for reading vector graphic data in LabVIEW. It accepts the path of SVG file and generates an array of XY graphs where each graph represents a single curve (line, elliptic arc, rectangle, polygon, polyline, quadratic and cubic Bezier's curves) from the file. SVG Reader.vi does not support text tags. Any text tag in the SVG file will be ignored at the output of the VI.
