Full Description:
**<color=0000FF><size=14>LabVIEW Task Manager<color=000000></size> is a debugging tool for use during development.  A tree diagram displays detailed information on all VIs in memory, belonging to a selected project/target.  It allows for interacting with single or multiple selected VIs at a time, and has the following features: **
    * Selection of project/target
    * Lists all VIs in memory, grouped by class/library or disk folder, or a flat list
    * Searches for and enumerates clones in memory
    * DropIn VI for including dynamically referenced clones (Clone Beacon)
    * 'Refresh Now' (F5) re-reads all VIs in memory and adds new ones to the tree
    * Displays VI name, owning class/library, state, path, data size & code size
    * Displays VI FP Behavior, Reentrant?, Reentrancy Type, Paused? & Highlight?
    * Group by Class/Library or Folder, or display a Flat List
    * Sort by any column, ascending or descending
    * Filter out item types vi, ctl, and vit/ctt
    * Filter out vi.lib and global VIs
    * Filter out items from being displayed, per folder paths.
    * Tracking of, and ability to toggle, execution highlighting on multiple selected VIs
    * Tracking of paused VIs with ability to Pause/Resume/TogglePause multiple selected VIs
    * DropIn VI for pausing only while debugging
    * If a clone initiates a pause, a different pause symbol is used for all clones of that same reentrant original VI
    * Select multiple VIs and open or close their FPs or BDs
    * Double Click a VI from the tree to bring the BD (first choice) or FP to front, if already open
    * Select multiple top-level VIs and Abort them
    * Remotely close any VI's Front Panel
