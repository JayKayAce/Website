Full Description:
JSONtext is a library intended to make working with JSON in LabVIEW easy, fast and flexible.  It is based on high-speed text parsing, and does not involve any kind of intermediate representation of the JSON (the only thing passed between functions are JSON text strings).  

Supports searching for elements in the JSON using JSON Path notation (example '$.Users[*].Name').  

Extensive support for converting to/from LabVIEW types.  Can use <JSON> tag in cluster element names to identify strings that should retain JSON format.  

Allows formating JSON using 'Pretty Print'.

As extension to standard JSON, will allow Comments.  

**Note:** On Windows 10, it may be necessary to run VI Package Manager 'as an administrator' in order to install the VI Package.
