Full Description:
::Class Creator Utility v1.0::
 
The Class Creator Utility is a streamlined way of defining a new *.lvclass. In one dialog, a user can define the class name, inherit definition, documentation string, icon and wire color. The user can also select to inherit wire color from the parent.
 
The Class Creator Utility will create the class at 'OK' event and save the class to a new folder in the same directory as the active project in a folder with the 'Class Name' string value. This new class will be added to the 'My Computer' target of the active project. The user can move the class to the correct target from this point.
