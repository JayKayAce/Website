Vendor: Blue Origin

Author(s): Brent Justice
 
Full Description:
This package contains a lightweight wrapper around the native LabVIEW HTTP Client methods.

This library provides the following benefits:
- Adds debug log hooks specifically for the BlueLogParent package
- Properly parses and returns HTTP return code
- Properly parses and returns HTTP headers
- Simplifies error handling depending on HTTP return code

This code was heavily inspired by another toolit posted online here:
