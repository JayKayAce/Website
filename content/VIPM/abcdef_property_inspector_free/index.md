Full Description:
The Property Inspector Free Tool allows powerful filtering, searching, sorting and editing of 41 VI properties including VI Description, Data Size and Allow Debugging.  Items can be filtered by 17 object types including VIs, strict typedefs, variables and more.  By selecting a filter based on 41 criteria, a subset of VIs can be identified, then selected in the results window.  Specify one of 5 edit modes and apply changes to one of 21 properties of a single VI.  The full version will edit all the selected VIs.   Use **Global Exclusion** to search out tagged items.  **Persistent Selection** keeps items highlighted when filtering, searching and sorting.

Customize which properties are displayed.  Results can be sorted by any column either ascending or descending.  Additionally, VIs can be filtered by VI metrics to analyze the entire project for issues that would be very hard to find. 

This version supports mutiple targets including cRIO and FPGA.

Features available only in the paid version:
Edit all selected VIs in a single click
Custom list of favorite compound searches
Powerful scripting options allow additional search and edit operations with very little programming.
History of recent VI and QuickDrop scripts
Window Cascade, Tile and Stack
Several new selection options including compound select
Multiple VIs can be deleted from the project in multiple locations including LLBs in a single click
The resulting list can be exported for further analysis.
