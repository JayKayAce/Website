Full Description:
You just inherited a large project that has been under continuous development for years, and now you are tasked with improving performance and adding functionality while maintaining compatibility. The Eulogy LabVIEW add-on and toolkit makes navigating, learning, debugging, and refactoring a large project fun and easy. Use the Quick Drop Keyboard Shortcuts, the Shortcut Menu Plugin, and the custom Bookmark Manager to make excavation, necromancy, and fighting zombie hordes a part of your large, inherited codebase workflow.

Eulogy introduces the concept of 'graves' for tagging, modifying, and removing legacy code. Each grave is a Diagram Disable Structure with a tombstone (bookmark), a disabled Corpse frame (legacy code), and an enabled Spirit frame (refactored code). A grave provides a container for changing sections of code without changing its behavior, i.e. refactoring. This simple concept combines native LabVIEW features with a set of conventions to allow modification without loss in functionality. 

A LabVIEW API is also provided to programmatically use and extend the add-on. The toolkit is ideal for incorporating Eulogy-related tasks into automated build systems.
