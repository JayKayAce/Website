Full Description:
The LabVIEW State Diagram Toolkit assists in large scale application development by providing a visual editor in which you can build state machines in LabVIEW using a state-specific notation. Using the State Diagram Toolkit, you can create a state diagram that reflects a complex decision-making algorithm while LabVIEW simultaneously generates the block diagram code necessary to implement the state machine. When debugging, the execution of the code simultaneously reflects in the associated state diagram.

The manual is installed with the toolkit in <font=Courier>labview\\manuals</font>.
