Full Description:
The Syslog protocol is a simple UDP communication standard for sending messages from distributed systems and processes to a central collector for logging and later analysis. It can be used for debugging embedded and distributed applications by sending simple messages from the embedded code to a separate system running the syslog collector, also called the syslog server or daemon.
