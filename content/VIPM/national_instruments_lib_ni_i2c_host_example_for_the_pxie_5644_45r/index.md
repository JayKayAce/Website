Redirecting to https://www.vipm.io/package/national_instruments_lib_ni_i2c_host_example_for_the_pxie_5644_45r

Vendor: National Instruments

Author(s): National Instruments
 
Full Description:
**This example replaces LabVIEW 2012 support with LabVIEW 2013 support.  In addition to the VIPM resolved dependencies, the following *must* be present on the system for correct operation:

Hardware:
NI PXIe-5644R/45R/46R

Software:
RFSA 2.9 or 2.9.1
RFSG 1.9.7 or 1.9.8**

This example demonstrates I2C communication via the digital input/output (DIO) connector an an NI Vector Signal Transceiver (VST).  The example can communicate with a simulated slave device by leaving the VHDCI unconncected or with an actual I2C slave by making the correct connections defined in the example front panel.
