Full Description:
The Programmable Wireless Stamp (PWS) is a low cost micro-controller based wireless board tailored to general test and measurement, wireless data acquisition and IoT applications. The PWS is based off of the ESP-WROOM-02, a high performance wireless SOC by Espressif, especially designed for space and power constrained wireless data acquisition and IoT applications. 

The Programmable Wireless Stamp include a general purpose I/O connector for direct sensor connectivity as well as three PMOD connectors, one I2C, one SPI and one UART/GPIO, for plug and play I/O extension and utilization of the growing ecosystem of PMOD signal conditioning modules.

The Programmable Wireless Stamp firmware can be programmed in  National Instruments LabVIEW. A full set of LabVIEW API VIs is made available for easy access to the Stamp peripherals in LabVIEW. Two LabVIEW Templates are also provided to jump start your IoT and wireless data acquisition applications.

The Stamp can be powered by an external Lithium Polymer battery for standalone operation. It also includes battery charger capability and constantly monitors its battery health status, generating user notifications messages when it is time for battery charging. Battery charging can be accomplished by simply plugging the PWS on a computer USB port.

A SD Card can be inserted in the Stamp' SD Card connector for local data logging. The HW includes a Real Time Clock (RTC) for time stamped sensor data acquisition and data logging.

The Programmable Wireless Stamp is ideally suited for the following applications:
'	Low-power remote data logging
'	Low-power remote monitoring and control
'	IoT (Internet of Things) application
'	Distributed embedded monitoring and control
'	Wireless data acquisition
