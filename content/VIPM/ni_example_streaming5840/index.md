Full Description:
This example uses an FPGA Extensions Bitfile to extend the DMA streaming capability of the PXIe-5820 & PXIe-5840 Vector Signal Transceiver to 1.25 GHz of RF bandwidth. For DMA streaming (record and playback), 64-bit LabVIEW is highly recommended.

This package supports the following NI Hardware:
NI PXIe-5820
NI PXIe-5840

This package requires the following NI Software:
LabVIEW 2018 (32 or 64 bit) or later. 64-bit is recommended for stream to disk applications.
NI-RFSA 18.2 or later
NI-RFSG 18.2 or later
NI-Common Instrument Design Libraries
NI-FlexRIO 18.0 (For bit-packing DLL)
