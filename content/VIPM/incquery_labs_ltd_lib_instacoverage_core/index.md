Full Description:
InstaCoverage Core is the free version of the InstaCoverage Pro unit testing tool for LabVIEW (http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/hu/nid/216652). InstaCoverage is not only highly efficient (e.g., it clearly outperforms the UTF tool in terms of execution time), it is also feature-rich with built-in tools for test harness generation, easy test configuration, and automated test execution. The Pro version of InstaCoverage adds support for advanced harness generation, automatic code coverage measurement, and it offers a flexible API for continuous integration and other applications.

Main features:

 - Flexible unit tests based on setup, teardown, harness VIs; also works with LabVIEW OOP.
 - HTML and XML reporting of test results.
 - Testing functionalities integrated into the LabVIEW development environment.
