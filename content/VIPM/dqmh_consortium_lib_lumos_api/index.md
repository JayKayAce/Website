Full Description:
The Lumos toolkit allows you to monitor the communication inside your application – live and in real time! 

With a little bit of VI Scripting magic, the tool taps into your code and adds hooks so it can listen in on the events being sent between your modules. The viewer then displays the logged messages in a sequence-style diagram.
