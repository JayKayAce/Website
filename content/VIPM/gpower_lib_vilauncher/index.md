Full Description:
This toolset simplifies the task of launching a VI dynamically and optionally transferring startup data to it. Dynamic launching is the process where you run a VI defined at runtime, contrary to a static VI defined at edit-time (e.g. an ordinary subVI dropped on the block diagram).
