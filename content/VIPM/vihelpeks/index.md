Full Description:
VI Helpeks is a utility used to build HTML help for VIs and palettes in the style of NI LabVIEW Help. Help files can contain the connector pane image with hotspots on terminals, descriptions for the VI, terminals, values for enumerated data types, and so on. VI Helpeks generates help files based on information taken from the source files, but also allows you to customize the content of the help files individually or as a group.

After you install VI Helpeks, launch it form the LabVIEW Tools menu. You may need to restart LabVIEW in order to populate the menu.
