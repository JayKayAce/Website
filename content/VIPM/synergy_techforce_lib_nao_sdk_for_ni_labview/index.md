Full Description:
NAO is the most widely used humanoid robot for academic purposes worldwide. With its versatile platform, scientists can explore a wide variety of research topics in robotics as well as computer science, human-machine interaction, and the social sciences.
The TechForce Robot NAO SDK Library helps LabVIEW and NAO developers easily interface with Aldebaran NAO. The SDK provides a native LabVIEW implementation of the NAOqi API. NAOqi is software already installed in NAO¡¯s hardware.
 Developers can communicate with NAOqi using a variety of computer languages. Programmers can create applications to control almost all the modules of NAO, including motion, vision, sound, audio, sensors, and behavior.
