Full Description:
The Extended Tiny Encryption Algorithm (XTEA) is a block cipher encryption algorithm that is very simple to implement, has fast execution time, and takes minimal storage space. It was designed to improve on weaknesses of the XTEA algorithm. The included example is to be compiled and used on a LabVIEW FPGA target.
