Full Description:
**Database Connectivity Toolkit for Big Data**
 is a library, which consists of low-level DLL functions, which you can perform both common database 
tasks and advanced customized tasks.
Generally, the toolkit consists of Low-level DLL written in C programming language and meant to establish 
fast and reliable communication with DBMS using ODBC 3.x API .

The following list describes the main features of the toolkit:

1. Works with any database driver that complies with ODBC.
2. Maintains a high level of portability. In many cases, you can port an application to another 
    database by changing the connection information you pass to the 'Connect.vi'
3. Converts database column values from native data types to standard ODBC 3.x API data types.
4. Permits the use of SQL statements with all ODBC supported database systems.
5. Provides multiuser access to MS SQL databases.
