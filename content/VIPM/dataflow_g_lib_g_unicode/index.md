Full Description:
A LabVIEW library for displaying Unicode, manipulating Unicode strings, and performing file I/O on Unicode paths.

* Drop-in Unicode replacements for string, file I/O, and user dialog functions
* Unicode path support
-- Read/write filenames and paths which contain Unicode - no more '?????' paths
-- Native system file dialog which returns unicode paths
-- File references opened from Unicode paths compatible with LabVIEW's File I/O functions
* All Unicode data is internally encoded as UTF-8, stored in new UTF-8 String and UTF-8 Path class types
* New VIs accept both standard LabVIEW strings/paths and UTF-8 String/Path class inputs
* Custom probes allow viewing Unicode text when debugging
* Custom QuickDrop plugin allows viewing and editing UTF-8 String/Path constant values
* VIs for reading and writing Unicode text to LabVIEW controls
