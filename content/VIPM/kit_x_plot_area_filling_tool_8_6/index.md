Full Description:
The Plot Area Filling Tool provides another way to fill the plot areas of LabVIEW waveform graph by creating a filled area image and inserting it into the background of the graph. 
In this way, the grid lines are not covered, the translucent areas show the curve overlapping more clearly, and the graph can also have a better appearance.
As the single VI in this tool, the Plot Area Filling VI needs to be called when you change the graph value or some other relevant properties.
