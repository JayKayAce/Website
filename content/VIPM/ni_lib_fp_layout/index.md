Full Description:
The Front Panel Layout utility provides the ability to use a single VI’s front panel with various different window sizes and layout configurations.  This is useful when you want to use one VI as a user interface, which can be used on multiple monitors of different screen resolutions.  The utility stores the position and size information of every front panel object in a configuration file next to the VI.  When the VI is loaded, it can size itself and all its front panel objects based on whichever configuration file is present.
