Full Description:
The Biometric Login Toolkit is a plug-in for LabVIEW which enables functionality for managing enrollment, identification, verification, and diagnostics to create a more secure application.  The toolkit allows developers to restrict access to specified application features based on login level and enables tracking application activity (who did whatâ€¦ and when).

The toolkit includes everything you need to implement user login today, including dialogs for Employee Enrollment, Fingerprint Enrollment, Login (By Finger), Login (By Finger or Name/Password), Login (By Name/Password), New Password, Fingerprint Reader Diagnostics, Display Colors, and Identification Parameters.

Biometric Key Features:
-	Secure:  Eliminate the risk of false identification associated with text dialogs and name badges  (actual fingerprint images are not retained)
-	Fast:  No typing required for identification or verification activities
-	Reliable:  Utilizes the very latest, award-winning, fingerprint recognition software
-	Maintenance Free:  No passwords to remember or reset
-	Configurable:  Customize access levels, identification match parameters, fingerprint template colors, and whether to display a substitute image during login

Rich feature set, simple integration:
-	Launches all dialogs in VI Server to facilitate integration into any architecture
-	Supports multiple simultaneous applications while restricting access to the fingerprint reader
-	Identification (1-to-many) and Verification (1-to-1) modes
-	SQL Server database schema is provided
-	Included example demonstrates all aspects of the implementation

Problems solved:
-	Ignoring application security because of project schedules or budgets
-	Security risk inherent to text based login and name badges
-	Password aging and maintenance
-	Repetitive Name/Password dialogs hinder end user productivity
