Full Description:
This toolkit, based on the Quantum Circuit Model, is an attempt to bring quantum programming to LabVIEW. With an unusual design approach, it allows us to compose and simulate quantum algorithms while using the programming tools of LabVIEW. At the current stage, it is more of a proof-of-concept project to be introduced among the related community and a call for collaboration.  Any feedback, therefore, would be greatly appreciated. 

With expandability and modularity in mind, the base calculation VIs (gates) are developed on the abstract class concept from OOP. Therefore, new classes can easily override the old ones for better performance. Later potential improvements can be, the already known optimized algorithms for simulation, use of sparse linear algebra, and GPU-accelerated calculations. 

After installation, open the 'Guide' VI from the 'Examples' palette for an introductory guide and explore other available examples to see them in action.
