Full Description:
The NI Cloud Toolkit for AWS allows you to write LabVIEW code to interface with various Amazon Web Services. To learn more about Amazon Web Services, visit http://aws.amazon.com.

This release of the NI Cloud Toolkit for AWS includes support for the following Amazon Web Services: S3, SNS, SQS, and IoT. However, the toolkit also includes a base class generic implementation for interfacing to any Amazon Web Service. This means that you can install this toolkit, then write your own class to implement communication with Amazon Web Services other than those included with the toolkit.
