Full Description:
LB Drive is a library of VIs to control compact positioning drives with Modbus TCP interface manufactured by Lenord+Bauer.

The VIs allow the motion control of several drives by simple functions without the need of knowing the internal process structure or the communication protocol. Additionally you can configure all available drive parameters like position limits for more complex applications.
For a quick start, the drives need only be connected to a running ethernet infrastructure that provides IPs to the drives.

Visit www.lenord.de for further information about the compact positioning drives with Modbus TCP interface (GEL61xxMB product family).
