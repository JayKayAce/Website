Full Description:
Advanced Calculations on Curves package represents a set of VIs that can be very useful in applications with graph measurements and analysis. The main advantage of the package is that it gives opportunity to do measurements on closed curves as well as on open ones. Package assembles VIs that calculate surface of a graph, find points of a graph that correspond to given levels, obtain crossing points of two curves and split the given curve into waveform sections. i.e. sections with X coordinate changing monotonically.

Note, VI Package Manager 2014 is required to install the package.
