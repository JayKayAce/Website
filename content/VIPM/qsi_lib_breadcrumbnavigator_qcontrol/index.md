Vendor: QSI

Author(s): Quentin 'Q' Alldredge
 
Full Description:
The BreadcrumbNavigator QControl is a QControl that inherits from and extends the String control. It acts like a list of HTML-Like links to help provide navigation in an application.

Add items through an included property. Clear all items through an included method.

When an item is clicked on, any thing after it is removed from the list and the clicked item is returned.

It requires the QControl Toolkit.
