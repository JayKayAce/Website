**<color=red>Major Version Upgrade Notes:</color>**

Major feature improvements have been incorporated into version 3 of the Custom PDF generator, which has required considerable internal changes. When upgrading please consider the following:

1)      Version 3 requires a new license to be issued by Simplicity. Please contact us via info@simplicityai.com for more information.
2)      When upgrading to version 3, version 2 must first be removed, as it is not compatible. During the installation of the version 3 package, a prompt relating to automatic removal of 2 version should appear.
3)      When opening up projects built using version 2, manual relinking of Custom PDF Generator VIs will be required. VIs may appear with a question mark icon and the user required to manually locate the files. The 'Upgrade Notes' section of the Custom PDF Generator help file provides assistance with this process.
