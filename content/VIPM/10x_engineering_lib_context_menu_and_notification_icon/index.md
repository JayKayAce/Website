Full Description:
This toolkit requires VIPM 2017 and .NET framework 4.0 or higher and is compatible with LabVIEW 2015 (32 and 64 bits) or later as well as Windows XP or later. 

Toolkit allows LabVIEW users to create the custom and specific Context Menus on the taskbar of the Windows OS that appears upon user interaction, such as a right-click mouse operation. A context menu offers the set of choices that are available in the current state, or context, of the operating system or application to which the menu belongs. 
Extremely customizable, and easy to use Toolkit allows LabVIEW users to create the custom and specific context menus and notification icons on the taskbar of the Windows OS. 
It enables all items on-fly  modifications (add/remove, change the font, text, size, control ,visibility etc. )  and connects user activity to LabVIEW through the specific event nodes.

More professional user experience , and software architecture is now possible. You can create the specific menu for your application in Windows taskbar , connect the user activity to the main program and provide an useful information to the user via generated notification windows.
