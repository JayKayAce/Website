Full Description:
Caraya Unit Test Framework is an open source unit testing framework for LabVIEW. It takes a whole new approach to unit testing; your VI is your test. Caraya allows you to convert your manual test VIs you use for debugging into unit test cases with nearly no effort. Even running the tests is easy, just run the test case VI. Caraya significantly lowers the barrier for developers to write unit tests leading into improved overall code quality in real-world projects where developers donâ€™t always have the luxury to write unit test cases first.

It runs on real-time targets and in the run-time engine too!
