Vendor: NI

Author(s): IPNet
 
Full Description:
The Encryption Algorithms library is a part of the the LabVIEW FPGA IPNet and provides FGPA IP and examples related to adding encrpytion to FPGA applications using the TEA and XTEA algorithms as well as protection FPGA IP by locking the bitfile to specific hardware.

Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA): The Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) is a block cipher encryption algorithm that is very simple to implement, has fast execution time, and takes minimal storage space. The included example is to be compiled and used on a LabVIEW FPGA target.

Extended Tiny Encryption Algorithm (XTEA): The Extended Tiny Encryption Algorithm (XTEA) is a block cipher encryption algorithm that is very simple to implement, has fast execution time, and takes minimal storage space. It was designed to improve on weaknesses of the TEA algorithm. The included example is to be compiled and used on a LabVIEW FPGA target.

FPGA-Based HW/SW Lock Key: An example of how to create and use an encryption scheme on your FPGA bitfile for protecting FPGA IP from being distributed to any other hardware except what was intended by the original distributor.

Additional Information:
The libraries provided here are part of the LabVIEW FPGA IPNet. IPNet is a one-stop resource for browsing, understanding, and downloading LabVIEW FPGA functions or IP (intellectual property) and is a collection of FPGA IP and examples gathered from the LabVIEW FPGA function palette, internal National Instruments developers, and the LabVIEW FPGA community.
