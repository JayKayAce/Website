Full Description:
The **MDI Toolkit** enables developers to create Multiple Document Interface (MDI) applications quickly and easily on Windows platforms.

It encapsulates the Windows API functions to create child windows and adds powerful management functions such as tile, cascade, dock/undock and flash child panels' titlebars. Mouse and front panel events  are simultaneously  propagated from the child panels so that the MDI application is fully aware of user activities.
