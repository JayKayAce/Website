Vendor: National Instruments

Author(s): National Instruments
 
Full Description:
The NI Streaming Host Example for the NI 5668R provides a multi-device stream to disk reference example for the NI PXIe-5668R vector signal analyzer.  The example is capable of streaming 12 bit data at IQ rates up to 1 GS/s and 16 bit data at IQ rates up to 500 MS/s.

The example utilizes the NI EDVR Input Stream plug-in architecture in order to leverage the external data value reference (EDVR) asynchronous TDMS library.

The package also provides an example for connecting another NI RIO device to an NI 5668R via a peer-to-peer stream.
