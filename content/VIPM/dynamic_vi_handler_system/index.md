Full Description:
**Dynamic VI Handler is a collection of VIs to programmatically**
- Load, run, handle, and release VIs on demand.
- Join separately developed VIs to a Dynamic System.
- Upscale existing systems by adding VIs.
- Transfer data to idle or running VIs.
- Occupy RAM only by called VIs.
- Reduce processor load by closing VIs.
- Enhance user experience by preloading.

**Handler Actions**
- Abort-Close
- Abort
- Close
- Get_Controls
- Hide
- Recall_Settings
- Run Hidden
- Run Standard
- Save
- Save_Settings
- Set_Controls
- Show
- Stop Smoothly
- Stop-Close Smoothly

**Examples**
- Placed  in Folder <LabVIEW>\\examples\\PhysicsConsult\\Dynamic VI Handler 
- Accessed from LabVIEW in two ways:
   - LabVIEW > Menu Tools > Dynamic VI Handler
   - LabVIEW > Menu Help > Find Examples > Browse > Directory Structure > PhysicsConsult > Dynamic VI Handler.

**Examples**
(1) **Simple Example** - Simply Control Target VI by selecting Handler Action.
(2) **VI Handler Demo** - Control Target VI by selecting Handler Action.
(3) **Coupled Controls** - Share Control between several VIs.
(4) **Set Arbitrary Control** - Set Arbitrary Control of Target VI.
(5) **Get Arbitrary Control** - Get Arbitrary Control from Target VI. 
(6) **Dynamic System** - Handle SubVIs Dynamically and Transfer Data between them. 
    Use as template for Program-Controlled Interacting Dynamic Systems.

**Reference to Used VI Sources**
VIs in Palettes and Examples are based on 
- LabVIEW VIs 
- OpenG Toolkit VIs
