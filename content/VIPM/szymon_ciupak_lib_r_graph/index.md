Vendor: Szymon Ciupak

Author(s): Szymon Ciupak
 
Full Description:
**R Graph** is a package that allows you to create good-looking graphs using R language. Scatter, bar, box, contour and line plots are supported along with histograms and heatmaps. The graphs can be also modified in a number of ways, e.g. by adding annotations, error bars or regression. It is also possible to create publication-ready graphs by placing a single VI.

REQUIRED SOFTWARE
To enjoy full functionality, you need to have R installed with ggplot2 package. Without those packages, it will only be possible to create and save the R code and data (displaying and saving graphs requires execution of R code). R can be downloaded from https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
Once R is downloaded and installed, ggplot2 package needs to be obtained. To do so, open R GUI (Start -> R -> R i386 or R x64), type **install.packages('ggplot2')** in the console and press Enter. You may be prompted to choose a mirror server. This process is desribed in pictures in Help Document for this package - once it is installed, you will find it in LabVIEW in Help -> Szymon Ciupak -> R Graph...
