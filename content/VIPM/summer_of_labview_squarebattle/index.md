Full Description:
Installs a new Summer of LabVIEW Project Template that can be used to create new SquareBattle Teams. A Team is a single player's collection of squares that can wait, move, replicate, and attack to try and have the most active squares by the end of a game.

Once a new project is created using the Summer of LabVIEW Square Battle project template, open the readme in the project for further instructions and tips.
