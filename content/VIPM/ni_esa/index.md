Full Description:
This package contains a palette and an Event Source Actor class, which adds capabilities to your Actor Oriented applications. 

Actors can inherit from Event Source Actor to:

- provide registering and unregistering for events,
- generate events to notify all registered actors,
- directly integrate into standard actor oriented messaging,
- implement truly reusable actors,
- use fully OO implementation of Events,
- make handling addresses fast and easy,
