Full Description:
The MakerHub Interface for the PS4 Controller makes it easy to read all button and axis data from a PS4 Controller. Start by simply polling the controller using LabVIEW's standard open, read, close paradigm. More complex applications can take advantage of the build in support for buttons state change events.
