Full Description:
The AndOn API is an API developed in LabVIEW to provide a simplified component for developers that desire to communicate with the AndonApp portal. This API is constructed to run in the background as a module that accepts messages from the API library. The architecture simplifies the decoupling of the API performance from the developer's application logic. Because of its loose coupling, the API is perfectly suited for the TestStand development environment.
