Full Description:
This toolkit provides an interface to Amazon's S3 (Simple Storage Service) service. Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers providing a way to easily store content in the cloud with an exceptionally high redundancy, within multiple geographical regions across the world. To learn more about Amazon S3, go to: http://aws.amazon.com/s3/

To use this toolkit, you have to register with Amazon AWS at: http://aws.amazon.com/

A large portion of the S3 API is implemented, allowing to create and manage buckets (buckets are the fundamental container in Amazon S3 for data storage), upload/download/manage objects/files.

The toolkit is built only on standard LabVIEW functions, allowing its usage within both PC and RT applications created with LabVIEW. There are no package or Toolkit dependencies.
