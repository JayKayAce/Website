Full Description:
The VIs in this collection perform clipping (intersection, union, difference, xor) operations on polygon sets. It is super fast and very robust. Additionally, you can also compute growing and shrinking (offset) operations as well as parameter calculations (area, length, bounding boxes) on polygon sets.
You can calculate the signed distance of a point to all polygons in a polygon set. This way you can also determine if a point is inside or outside of a polygon.
