Vendor: Amulet Technologies

Author(s): Brian Deters
 
Full Description:
This package installs all of the functions needed to communicate with an Amulet Color Display Module into the LabVIEW Connectivity palette. It also provides both simple and complex examples in both GEMstudio and LabVIEW to help you get started.

If you plan to use USB to communicate to the PC, you must  install GEMstudio Pro, which includes the USB driver, prior to using the functions in this package. This can be found at www.amulettechnologies.com

The examples are located at:
<OS User Documents>\\GEMstudio Pro\\LabVIEW Demos

There is also a getting started guide in the integrated help file which will teach you about GEMstudio and the basics of reading and writing to the Amulet Module's InternalRAM variables. You can access this though the detailed help of any of the VIs in the palette, or directly from here, after installation:
