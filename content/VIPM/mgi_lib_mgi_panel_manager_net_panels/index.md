Full Description:
This is an extension to the MGI panel manager that provides two new panel types. 

**MDI Panels**
This allows developers to quickly implement a Multiple Document Interface (MDI) in their application. An MDI is a common graphical user interface in which serveral windows are contained in another window.

**Tab Panels**
This uses the .NET TabControl to implement dynamic and easy to maintain tab controls. This allows you to add and remove tabs as needed at runtime.
