Full Description:
RTI DDS Toolkit for LabVIEW is built on the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard, the leading data-centric publish/subscribe (DCPS) messaging standard for integrating distributed real-time applications. The VI blocks in this toolkit allow you to easily publish and share data between multiple LabVIEW applications or between LabVIEW and non-LabVIEW applications. 

Features at a glance:
- Seamless integration between LabVIEW and other applications implemented in C, C++, Java, C#/.Net, and Ada
- Peer-to-peer data communication
- Dynamic peer discovery
- Substantially reduce application programming effort
- Many customizable Quality of Service parameters available for fine tuning application behavior without coding
