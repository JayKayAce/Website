Full Description:
NI Vision OpenCV Utilities enables you to use OpenCV algorithms with NI embedded hardware in LabVIEW.

This VI package includes:

1. OpenCV prebuilt binaries for Windows and NI Linux Real-Time. 
2. C++ development files to create interfaces between the NI Vision image and OpenCV Mat. 
3. C++ development files to interface with LabVIEW arrays and C++ arrays. 
4. Sample LabVIEW APIs to call OpenCV Wrapper DLL entry points. 
5. LabVIEW examples. 
6. Visual Studio and Eclipse examples for creating OpenCV wrapper APIs.

Refer to the NI Vision OpenCV Support Help, which is installed to National Instruments\\Vision\\Help, for more information. In LabVIEW, refer to Help>>Find Examples>>Directory Structure>>Vision>>NIVision OpenCV Utilities for examples. 

Run VI Package Manager as an administrator before installing this package and restart the computer after installation.
