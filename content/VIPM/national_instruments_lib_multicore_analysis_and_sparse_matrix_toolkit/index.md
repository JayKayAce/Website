Full Description:
The LabVIEW Multicore Analysis and Sparse Matrix Toolkit enables you to create applications that leverage multicore technologies for computing performance-sensitive mathematics and analysis algorithms. The Multicore Analysis and Sparse Matrix Toolkit also provides sparse matrix data types and VIs which enable you to solve large-scale problems that dense matrices are unable to handle. The Multicore Analysis and Sparse Matrix VIs support single-precision and double-precision floating-point numbers. You can use the Multicore Analysis and Sparse Matrix Toolkit on Windows and NI ETS real-time operating systems only.
