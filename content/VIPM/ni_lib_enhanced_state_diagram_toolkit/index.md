Vendor: National Instruments

Author(s): National Instruments
 
Full Description:
Note: This product is the Enhanced State Diagram Toolkit. The original 'LabVIEW State Diagram Toolkit' is still supported and available on the LabVIEW Tools Network. The Enhanced State Diagram Toolkit is updated with some new features. Additionally, almost all of the internal code has been moved out to G, making it much easier to modify. It's more flexible and can be a template for any other kind of external editor you might want to experiment with.

Currently, there is no way to migrate state machines between the two versions of the toolkit.

The Enhanced State Diagram Toolkit assists in large scale application development by providing a visual editor in which you can build state machines in LabVIEW using a state-specific notation. Using this toolkit, you can create a state diagram that reflects a complex decision-making algorithm while LabVIEW simultaneously generates the block diagram code necessary to implement the state machine. When debugging, the execution of the code simultaneously reflects in the associated state diagram.

The manual is installed with the toolkit in <font=Courier>labview\\manuals</font>.
