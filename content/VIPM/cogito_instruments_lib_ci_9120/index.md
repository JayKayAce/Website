Full Description:
This package will deploy drivers for the Cogito Instruments CI 9120 module, as well as an example.
The CI 9120 is an artificial neural network composed of 1024 neurons that can perform pattern matching and machine learning. It is addressed in FPGA mode using the API deployed by this package. 

LabVIEW 2014 or later is required
LabVIEW FPGA module is required.
NI-RIO 14.0 or later is required.

The CI 9120 has been tested with the following cRIO targets:
cRIO-9030, cRIO-9031, cRIO-9033, cRIO-9035, cRIO-9036, cRIO-9037, cRIO-9038, cRIO-9039, cRIO-
9063, cRIO-9064, cRIO-9065, cRIO-9066, cRIO-9067, cRIO-9068, cRIO-9073, cRIO-9074, cRIO-9075,
cRIO-9076, cRIO-9081, cRIO-9082,
sbRIO-9607, sbRIO-9627, sbRIO-9637.
