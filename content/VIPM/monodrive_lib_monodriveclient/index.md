Provides a LabVIEW interface to the monoDrive Autonomous Vehicle Simulator. You are able to interact with the simulator in three modes: Closed Loop,  Replay, HIL.

In Close Loop mode you will be able to control car speed and steering angle. 
In Replay mode you will be able to replay a trajectory that you saved.
In HIL  mode you will be able to playback a trajectory that you saved and at the same time change the pose of the ego vehicle with data generated from another source.

You will have access to the data generated from the sensors like RGBA camera, semantic camera, grayscale camera, fisheye camera, radar, LiDAR, semantic LiDAR,  RPM, GPS, IMU, Ultrasonic and Waypoint.

Allows you to configure different weather conditions.

You can download the simulator from **https://www.monodrive.io/download**
