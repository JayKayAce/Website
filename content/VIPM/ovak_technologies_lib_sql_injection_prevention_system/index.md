Full Description:
The purpose of this toolkit is to detect some types of SQL injection. It is implemented with the signature-based method, i.e. it detects specific types of injections.
These special types are the following:
  1. AND/OR Attack
  2. White Space Manipulation Attack
  3. Hexademical/Decimal/Binary Variation Attack
  4. Comments Attack
  5. String Concatenation Attack
  6. UNION Injection Attack
The protection against the first three types of attacks is implemented in this program.
