Full Description:
This library presents an implementation of dual numbers and forward-mode automatic differentiation.

Currently, all basic and trigonometric functions are implemented, mirroring the primitives included in LabVIEW for normal numbers. The primitives have inputs compatible with both normal numbers in LabVIEW and dual numbers using malleable VIs, but their output will always output a dual number.

Evaluations of a dual number function, derivative, partial derivative, gradient, directional derivative, and Jacobian are implemented. A simple instance of Newton's method is also provided.
