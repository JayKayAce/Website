Full Description:
The **SEA LTE-V Add-On for LabVIEW - FULL API** delivers a suite to build V2X (Vehicle-To-Anything) related applications in LabVIEW based on LTE technlogies (3GPP TS 36.300). This package provides: (1) MON functions palette (API) for monitoring and timing manipulation, (2) RFC functions palette (API) for measurement and validation of RF-signals, (3) Host Control Manager (HCM-FULL+CEM) as abstraction layer beween the APIs and the local V2X communication hardware, (4) examples, (5) user documentation.
**Compatible OS Versions:** Windows 7, Windows 10
**Software Requirements:**
- LabVIEW RTE 2015 SP1 (required for HCM)
- NI-USRP 15 (or higher) Instrument Driver Software (required for HCM) for USRP-92953/54
- NI-VST 15 (or higher) Instrument Design Libraries (required for HCM) for PXIe-5644
**Hardware Requirements:**
- NI PXIe-5644 (VST) or
- NI USRP-2953/54 (SDR)
**Important Notes:**
**1.** The latest version of the VIPM is required. For details on the JKI VI Package Manager see:

**2.** The HCM installation is separated from this vip installation. However, the HCM installer is started automatically at the end of this installation. **The HCM installation requires administrator rights, hence, if HCM is to be installed this vip need to be installed with administrator rights as well.**
**3.** HCM requires activation for operation after a 30-days trial period.
**4.** Older versions of the HCM are not automatically uninstalled during this installation, so multiple versions can co-exist. If older versions are no more used we strongly recommend to uninstall them.
