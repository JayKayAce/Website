Full Description:
This example provides a simple source synchronous data transfer interface that is capable of streaming data to another DIO device at up to 125 MHz. The output physical interface requires eight DIO lines (one byte) for data transfer, one line for data valid signaling, one line for flow control, and Clock Out for forwarding the data clock; therefore, a total of ten DIO lines and the Clock Out line are required for this IP, enabling generation up to 125 MB/s. The input physical interface and bandwidth is identical with the exception that Clock In is used rather than Clock Out.
