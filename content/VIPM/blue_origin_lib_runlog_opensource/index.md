Full Description:
A debug logger optimized for a process with a well defined start and stop point.

Things you are able to do:
- Start/stop multiple Runlog processes
- Open, explore, filter, and interact with log messages sent to a runlog process
- Export/stream runlog messages to a file on disk
- Import/stream runlog messages from a file on disk

Be aware that there exists a standlone Runlog viewer application.
I HIGHLY recommend installing this application if you intend to use this library.
The viewer application provides the following capabilitiy:
- Adds a unique icon to *.lvrlog files (unique files created by this toolkit)
- Double click of *.lvrlog files will open them with the viewing application
- Multiple instances of viewing appliction are allowed
- Viewing application allows user to explore, filter, and interact with a runlog
- Installed with NIPM
