Full Description:
This API provides a set of SubVIs to individually control the brightness of the four built-in LEDs of the myRIO.

To use this API:

Create a new project from the 'PWM API' Template which contains the necessary FPGA bitfile.  This bitfile contains all of the functionality of the default personality and adds the ability to set the duty cycle of the built-in LEDs.
