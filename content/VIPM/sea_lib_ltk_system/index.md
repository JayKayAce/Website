Full Description:
<color=blue>IMPORTANT NOTES:</color>
<color=blue>1. Please uninstall all previous **non-VI Package Manager (VIPM)** based versions of LTK before continue. The VIPM based	installer is not compatible with previous **non-VIPM** based LTK installations.</color>
<color=blue>2. For license activation/deactivation/transfer always start LabVIEW with administrator rights to ensure proper execution of the activation process. Hint: Right-click on LabVIEW.exe and select **Run as administrator**.</color>
The Localization Toolkit (LTK) for LabVIEW allows world wide usage of your software:
   - display user interfaces in any language
   - switch between font size and font type
   - switch between languages with the same code page on the fly
**For the user...**
...the advantage is to accomodate software interfaces easily to his habits. For languages with the same code page software can be switched while running. This feature includes also multi byte languages (e.g. Chinese). Font type and font size can also be changed.
**For the programmer...**
...the Localization Toolkit for LabVIEW is available in the LabVIEW function palette. The package includes an installer for the LabVIEW palette and programming examples. The language information is independent from LabVIEW code. Language information is stored in ASCII format and can be edited in the unicode format by standard tools as Notepad or Microsoft Excel - even by the end user. The definition of any languages in just one file is the result.
