Full Description:
This process uses the NI Software Watchdog library in conjunction with the RT  hardware watchdog to make sure that all of the processes register with it are still operating in a timely manner.  This process is meant to be executed on a RT target and will reboot the target if one of its registered processes does not respond as expected.
