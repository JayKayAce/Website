Full Description:
An event-based debug logger optimized for a continuously running application.

Things you are able to do:
- Start/stop multiple event log processes
- Open, explore, filter, and interact with event log messages sent to an event log process
- Export/stream event log messages to a file on disk
- Import/stream event log messages from a file on disk

Be aware that there exists a standlone event log viewer application.
I HIGHLY recommend installing this application if you intend to use this library.
The viewer application provides the following capabilitiy:
- Adds a unique icon to *.lvelog files (unique files created by this toolkit)
- Double click of *.lvelog files will open them with the viewing application
- Multiple instances of viewing appliction are allowed
- Viewing application allows user to explore, filter, and interact with a event log
- Installed with NIPM
