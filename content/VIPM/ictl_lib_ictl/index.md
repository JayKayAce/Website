Full Description:
Today's global, highly competitive business environment requires continually improving performance of industrial and consumer products as well as their manufacturing processes. While traditional solutions are reaching their limits, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is creating new opportunities for the development of smarter solutions in a broad range of applications, from robotics and aeronautics, to energy and even household appliances. 

Appreciating the need for a new generation of advanced controllers led to the development ICTL. ICTL features an exceptional combination of multiple artificial intelligence techniques to create novel Intelligent Control Systems without requiring users to have advanced knowledge of AI. The AI technology of ICTL can also be used for modeling, predicting and adjusting conventional controllers like PID controllers.
