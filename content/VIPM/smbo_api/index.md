Full Description:
**Overview**

SmBO-API  allows users to write and read time-series data to NoSQL SmBO database. 
The Driver is implemented to read and write the following data types:
Boolean, I32 (32-bit integer), I64 (64-bit integer), Single (single-precision floating-point numbers), Double (double-precision floating-point numbers), String (text), Variant (any type) and Waveform.

**Advantages**
- Fast writing  and reading of supported data types.
- Ability to return of timestamps of the every data point.
- Reading data by time range.

**Functionalities:**

Write single data point from single channel

Write multiple data points (array) from single channel

Write multiple data points from corresponding channels

Read data and timestamp which are within the specified time range from single channel

Read data and timestamp which are within the specified time range from corresponding channels

Browse all channels of the specified data type

Create new channel of specified data type with description and device data

Destroy existing channel of specified data type 

**Requirements**

 - LabVIEW 2015 32 /64 bit run-time engine
 - SmBO Time Series Database for IoT
______________________________________________

The API was tested on the LabVIEW 2015
