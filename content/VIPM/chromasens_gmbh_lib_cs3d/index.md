Vendor: Chromasens GmbH

Author(s): Chromasens GmbH
 
Full Description:
Chromasens GmbH has developed a new kind of process for colour 3D surface measurement based on its self-developed, trilinear CCD line scan camera technology. The system, that can be used in a variety of areas, is based on stereoscopic capturing and supports the capturing of almost any object size.

Through the fusion of high-quality line scan camera systems and state-of-the-art graphic processor technology, altitude values can be measured and displayed with the highest precision in real-time.

REMARK:
Chromasens 3D Camera Toolkit requires the installation of the Chromasens 3D API. The API is downloadable from the following link <color=blue>http://www.chromasens.de/sites/default/files/partner/3D/cs-3d-setup-current.exe</color>

Through the software is protected against unauthorized use, without a USB dongle the software only runs in demo-mode. The demo-mode is restricted to run only on the sample images shipped with the package.
Please, contact Chromasens support (<color=blue>support@chromasens.de</color>) in order to obtain a USB dongle for evaluation with full speed and on any image.
