Full Description:
When it comes to LabVIEW application development, the devil is in the details. Icons and buttons play an important role in the design of attractive UI. It could mean the difference between good user experiences versus the clunky ones. For developers, finding a good user interface kit is equivalent to finding treasure. It is like the geologist who finds a cool rock in his backyard.
“Custom Flat Buttons UI Controls” set includes more than 150 modern and the most popular custom buttons. With the help of our UI Control Set, you save the time and overcome one of the nettlesome challenges in UI design: spending hours, finding, editing and coloring the icons to be used in your custom controls.
