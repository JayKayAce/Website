Vendor: LabVIEW Open Source Project

Author(s): Francois Normandin
 
Full Description:
LV-MQTT-Connection
https://github.com/LabVIEW-Open-Source/MQTT-Connection

This package consists the fundamental building blocks for building MQTT clients and servers: 
- Session
- MQTT Base class to generically handle packets (overridable as client or server patterns)

It currently supports version 3.1.1 of the MQTT protocol (Protocol Level 4).

These classes can be used as the basis for client and server by providing a clean and easy control packet handling scheme via OOP.
