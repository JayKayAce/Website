Full Description:
WLR Test toolkit along with National Instruments PXI SMU modules is intended for semiconductor device reliability estimation, at the extreme ends of the device’s specifications (usually voltage and temperature). The WRT involves measurement of device degradation parameters based on HCI, NBTI failure mechanisms. 

 

System Requirements:

Windows 7 or later operations system,

NI LabVIEW 2016 or later (32-bit),

NI-DCPower 17.5 Instrument Driver

Supported Devices:

NI PXI-414x

It is recommended to run the VIPM and LabVIEW with admin rights.
