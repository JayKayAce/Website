Full Description:
Before designing and implementing a pH control system, it is wise to study and understand the pH process that you have so that proper solutions, equipment, and software can be acquired and installed. 

The Real-Time pH Process Modeling and Control Simulation Software is a useful tool for you to do pH process and pH control studies.  The software product is built in National Instruments' LabVIEW platform and includes: 
·	pH process diagram, 
·	a strong-acid-strong-base pH model,
·	a weak-acid-strong-base pH model,
·	a strong-acid-weak-based pH model, 
·	a weak-acid-weak-base pH model, 
·	MFA control simulation for the 4 pH processes using an MFA pH controller, 
·	PID control simulation for the 4 pH processes, 
·	On-Off control simulation for the 4 pH processes, 
·	Graphical interface with control faceplates and real-time trends, 
·	LabVIEW block diagrams, and
·	pH process model description, MFA controllers used, and recommended control strategy.     
Why Use Real-Time pH Process Models
Most process models are presented as mathematical equations or formulas, which are important but have limited usage. A real-time process model can be used as a virtual process to simulate a real process with minimal setup time and cost.  Using a virtual process or virtual plant to solve real process problems is a powerful and cost-effective way to help build a Smart Industry. 

CyboSoft's pH process models are delivered as VIs (virtual instruments) in LabVIEW. The user can design and test their pH control systems using the pH process models running in real time. For instance, a pH process model can run in a PC with real-time interface to a popular pH controller on the market or to an existing pH controller in service. The control results can be compared with the MFA pH control results obtained in MFA control simulation.  The user can then take the results, estimate the chemical reagent savings, and present the return-on-investment (ROI) to management when applying for budget to buy the proper pH controller or control software to improve pH control performance.
