Full Description:
The pipelined frequency transform (PFT) is a fixed sequence of frequency shifts and halfband resampling stages used to split an incoming complex data stream into multiple channels.  Each subsequent stage yields twice as many channels, with each channel operating at half the rate of the previous tier.  The chain provides gap-free coverage between -0.25fs and +0.25fs. Multiple chains may be combined to achieve greater coverage. Each channel is alias protected, and provides 80% bandwidth coverage due to filter roll-off.
