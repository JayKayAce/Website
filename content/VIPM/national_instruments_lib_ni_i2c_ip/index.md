Full Description:
Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) buses are commonly used to communicate between a controller (master) device and a target (slave) device. I2C buses require two lines for communication: clock (SCL) and serial data (SDA). This IP contains LabVIEW FPGA code for both an I2C master and an I2C slave.

**This IP is meant to be used in a LabVIEW FPGA single-cycle timed loop.**
