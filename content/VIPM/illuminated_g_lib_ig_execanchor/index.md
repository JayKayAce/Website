Full Description:
A simple mechanism to either have an event automatically generated when a launching execution hierarchy goes idle or provide the ability to poll the calling execution hierarchy's status. This is useful when launching asynchronous VIs that should close down when the execution hierarchy that launched the async VI finishes so that an async orphan isn't left running in the background.
