Full Description:
A layout system for LabVIEW frontpanel objects (controls) inspired by Qt5 (https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/layout.html).

==============================
Beware: Even though the version number suggests differently, 
this tool is still in beta state. At this time, it really only caters to 
a vertical grid layout.
