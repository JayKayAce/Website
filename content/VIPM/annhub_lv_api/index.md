Full Description:
LabVIEW Application Programming Interface (API) to use with Artificial Neural Network Hub (ANNHUB) software. 

ANNHUB software simplifies machine learning design and deployment for LabVIEW applications.

Key features of the ANNHUB
- Easy to use: Does not require expertise knowledge to design an AI model(s). No coding required, and straight forward design flow.
- Support advanced training algorithms: Scaled Conjugate Gradient, Levenberg Marquardt, Quasi-Newton, Bayesian Regularization (Bayesian Neural Network).
- Support different types of activations functions and cost functions.
- Support Confusion matrix, ROC curves, regression curves, performance metrics to evaluate the trained neural network model(s).
- Easy to deploy trained neural network model(s) to different environments, including LabVIEW, LabWindow CVI, C, C++, C#, Python, R, Swift, Javaâ€¦
