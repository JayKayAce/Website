Full Description:
The GTT LTE RBS Toolkit is a toolkit for efficient LTE RBS test. It is running on top of the NI PXI instrumentation covering all mandatory measurements as defined by 3GPP. For more information, see the GefleTestteknik Homepage.

**Installation:**
NOTE: To avoid issues with Windows access rights, make sure to start VIPM with admin righs (right click and select 'Run as administrator') before starting this installer using VIPM 2014. VIPM 2014 or later is required to install this package.

The installer for the GTT LTE RBS toolkit no longer includes an installer for the NI LTE toolkit. After the installation process make sure that the NI LTE toolkit no longer is present. If it is still present then manually uninstall with the NI uninstallation tool .

The executable GTT LTE RBS signal generator and analyzer is started via the Start menu -> Programs -> Gefle Testteknik -> LTE RBS. A User Guide is also available at this location.

The VIs are installed to [ProgramFiles]\\National Instruments\\[LabviewInstallDir]\\vi.lib\\GefleTestteknik

**Hardware and SW Requirements:**
