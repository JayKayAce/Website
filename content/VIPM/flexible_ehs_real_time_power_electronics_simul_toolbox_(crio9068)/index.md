Full Description:
Flexible eHS Real Time Power Electronics Simulation Toolbox (cRIO9068)  by OPAL-RT Technologies.

Flexible eHS Real Time Power Electronics Simulation Toolbox (cRIO9068) is an FPGA based electrical solver developed by OPAL-RT technologies for the NI compactRIO platform. The core of the system is an FPGA based electrical solver named eHS. eHS is a floating-point solver that enables the user to simulate an electric circuit on FPGA automatically, without having to write mathematical equations. The eHS firmware is reconfigurable, therefore it simulates different circuits without needing to change the FPGA firmware. It combines the simplicity of building electric circuits models using the SimPowerSystems Toolbox, Psim or Multisim 13 with the strength of OPAL-RT FPGA-based simulators to solve the currents and voltages within the circuit, in real-time with a sample time in the range from 100ns to 1us.
