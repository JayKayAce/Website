Full Description:
The Delacor Queued Message Handler (short: DQMH®) toolkit is a freely available reference design (also called a template or framework) for LabVIEW. It expands on the NI QMH by providing safe, event-based message handling and scripting tools to make development easy, encourage same style between different developers in the same project and improve efficiency. Today, the DQMH® is arguably the most popular LabVIEW framework out there.

The LabVIEW ecosystem often sees teams of software developers with members of varying proficiency. Teams that are growing rapidly. Teams that need to onboard new members regularly. Teams that need to employ subcontractors, and teams that don’t want to be dependent on a single source. DQMH® was created with these small teams in mind!

There’s a vast amount of content available: An exceptionally detailed manual, a plethora of videos and presentations, even podcasts! All of this makes it really easy to get new users of all proficiency levels up to speed very quickly. On top of that, there are lots of consultants – both the DQMH® Trusted Advisors and other 3rd parties – who are happy to offer courses, trainings and workshops for DQMH®.

This package installs all the packages needed for the DQMH toolkit:
DQMH Palette
DQMH Project Template
DQMH Event Scripter
DQMH Thermal Chamber Examples
