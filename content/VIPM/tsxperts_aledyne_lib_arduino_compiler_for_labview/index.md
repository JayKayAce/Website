Full Description:
The Arduino Compatible Compiler for LabVIEW is a compiler that will take a LabVIEW Virtual Instrument (VI) and compile it for the ArduinoTM programming language and will download the code to an ArduinoTM board.  The downloaded code will execute embedded and standalone on the Arduino target.  This is a great way to use existing knowledge of LabVIEW to program simple standalone embedded systems on low-cost hardware.  It is also a great educational tool to teach software programming to entry level students without the steep learning curve of text-based languages.

The compiler allows for a subset of LabVIEW functionality to be used.  Please refer to the installed palette and help manual to see a list of supported features and APIs.  Though the compiler handles memory management for the developer, please be aware of memory constraints.  The Arduino targets have very limited memory so care should be taken to limit or restrict usage of large and dynamic datatypes like strings and arrays, especially on smaller targets like the Uno.  Excessive memory usage can cause unexpected behavior at run-time.

This product requires the installation of the Arduino IDE which includes required hardware libraries and drivers.  You must first download and install version 1.5.7 or higher from http://arduino.cc/en/main/software.
