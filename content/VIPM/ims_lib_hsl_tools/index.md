Full Description:
HSL Tools convert from the RGB colorspace to the HSL color space and back.  In the HSL colorspace, you can  analyze, extract or modify elements of color by their use rather than their display components. This can be useful for programmatically generating a lighter or darker shade of a color in use, or generating colors to associate with any front panel control or VIs throughout an application or randomizing a color during runtime.  These VIs can be applied to a single color or used to convert entire images or color arrays.
