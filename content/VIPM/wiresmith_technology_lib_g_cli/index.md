Full Description:
G CLI (formerly LabVIEW CLI)  is a package that supports the client side of a two way command line interface. The package contains two parts:

* A Windows application which installs to the system path so it can be launched from the command line.
* A LabVIEW library that allows you to communicate with the application to pass data to the command line.

NOTE: Since the Windows application installs to path administrator access is required to install it.
