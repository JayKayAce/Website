Vendor: MIT

Author(s): MIT
 
Full Description:
Provides an easy-to-use framework for determining transfer functions of real-time controlled systems. Works with any NI real-time target.

The Dynamic Signal Analyzer has 4 parts:
1. Generating a swept sine wave to excite the system with.
2. Measuring the frequency response of a system at two points along the system.
3. Finding the magnitude and phase of those responses at several frequencies.
4. Plotting the magnitudes and difference of the phases at several frequencies (bode plot).

Required Hardware: any NI real-time target
Required Software: 
-LabVIEW Control Design and Simulation Module (not required for package itself, but used in examples)
-other requirements depend on real-time target, but may include: myRIO toolkit, DAQmx
