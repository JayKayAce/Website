Full Description:
JKI HTTP REST Client is a library for connecting LabVIEW applications with RESTful web services for creating Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) applications. This library extends LabVIEWâ€™s native HTTP client with powerful features such as support for the status code, support for multiple parallel requests, support for request specific HTTP headers and support for automatically escaping URLs. These useful features streamline the process of integrating LabVIEW applications with REST based web service APIs.
