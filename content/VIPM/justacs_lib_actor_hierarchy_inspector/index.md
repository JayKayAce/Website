Full Description:
The Actor Hierarchy Inspector displays the hierarchy of your Actor Framework project in real time.

To launch the tool, select **Show All Actors** from the Tools Â» AF Tools menu of your project file.  The tool's panel displays the current hierarchy in a tree control; the control will update as actors are launched or stopped. A **Stop All Actors** tool is also included.

You will see a panel that shows the unique ID, debug alias, and fully qualified names of all currently running actors, arranged in a tree view.

Right click on any actor in the hierarchy to bring up a shortcut menu of options for that actor.

**Ping** gives a measure of the responsiveness of the target actor.  The tool sends a message to the actor and measures the response time in seconds.

**Show Block Diagram** will open the block diagram of the target actor.

**Show Front Panel** will open the front panel of the target actor.

**Stop Actor\\Emergency Stop Actor** will send a Stop or Emergency stop to the target actor.

You may also stop all running actors by clicking the **Stop All Actors** button.

**Please note** that you must enable AF Debug tracing to use this tool.  Add the Conditional Disable Symbol 'AF_Debug_Trace', with the value 'TRUE' to your project's list of Conditional Disable Symbols.

We recommend closing LabVIEW before installing this package.
