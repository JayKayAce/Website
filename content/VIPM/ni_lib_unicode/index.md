Full Description:
LabVIEW for Windows has limited support for Unicode strings in the front panel controls and indicators. This is not an offically supported feature, meaning that it is not as fully tested as other released parts of the development and run-time environment. In addition this feature is not covered under standard product support and parts of this feature may change in future releases of LabVIEW, i.e. any code developed on this feature may require changes when upgrading to a newer version of LabVIEW. 

Given these limitations, these VIs provide basic functions to convert strings to and from Unicode (UTF-16LE) and to display these strings on various front panel indicators and controls.

Basic functions for conversion of text to and from UTF-8 are also included for interacion with web servcies and other web protocols.
