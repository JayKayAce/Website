Full Description:
The Programmable Switch for NI myRIO project demonstrates how to use the NI myRIO to wirelessly control a switch via your smartphone or any UDP-enabled device. This project is focused on controlling power to an electrical device that uses a standard power plug; for example, a lamp. This provides for many creative applications including home automation of lights or other electronics.

**READ DOCUMENTATION REGARDING SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS AND TIMING CONFIGURATION. This package requires you to install additional software to your NI myRIO and to configure its Time Settings in NI MAX.** To find the documentation, install the package and create a new Programmable Switch project. See the READ ME virtual folder inside the resulting LabVIEW project. 

To run this app:

1. Open LabVIEW
2. Select 'Create Project' from the Getting Started Window splash screen
3. Select the myRIO category underneath Sample Projects
4. Choose the Programmable Switch and complete the wizard to launch the project
5. Open RT Main.vi and Host Main.vi
6. Enter in your computer's IP address into the Host IP input and run RT Main.vi
7. Enter the myRIO's IP address in the myRIO IP input and run Host Main.vi
8. Push On to turn on the switch
9. Push Off to turn off the switch
10. Refer to the How to Use the Programmable Switch file in the Documentation virtual folder for instructions on using your smartphone to control the switch.
