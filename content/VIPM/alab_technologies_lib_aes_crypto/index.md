Full Description:
Implements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication 197 natively in LabVIEW. AES, also known as Rijndael, is the latest symmetrical Block Cipher standardized by NIST in 2001. It is adopted by the U.S. government and widely used worldwide. AES is the first publicly accessible and open cipher approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) for top secret information.

The original NIST publication 197 is accompanied by another publication (800-38A) which defines different modes of operation for the AES cipher block. This toolkit, implements both encryption and decryption circuits for all the standard key lengths (128, 192 and 256 bits). It also supports all the following modes of operation: ECB, CBC, OFB, CTR and CFB (4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 modes).

Please note that the publisher assumes the developers wishing to use this toolkit are already familiar with basic concepts of encryption algorithms and the AES encryption in particular.

Looking for another encryption algorithm that is not supported by this toolkit?
Contact us at Alab Technologies and we will be glad to implement it for you!
