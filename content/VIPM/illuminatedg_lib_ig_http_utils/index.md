Vendor: IlluminatedG

Author(s): Derrick Bommarito
 
Full Description:
Currently only includes functionality intended for use in a HTTP server. Eventually the library will be updated to include Request and Response building that would be useful in a client-side application.

Encapsulates parsing and handling of HTTP Requests and Responses. Can be used with IG Stream based libraries, such as IG TCP Stream, to work directly with communication streams. This package does not serve as a HTTP server by itself but provides much of the underlying data manipulation that can be used to create HTTP servers and clients. For a LV implementation of an HTTP server that provides similar mechanisms to LabVIEW Web Services, see the IG HTTP Server package.
