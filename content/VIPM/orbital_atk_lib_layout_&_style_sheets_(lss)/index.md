Full Description:
This LabVIEW Add On is designed to quickly stylize a user interface using a language formatted similar to the Cascading Style Sheets used to stylize webpages.  This offers some unique advantages over standard methods of controlling user interface appearance in LabVIEW.  By applying styles using style sheets, a user has the ability to change the background color of any user interface object using a single common name like 'background-color'	instead of digging through the property node menus.  This same idea can be used to set the size, position, and many other properties for UI objects.  This Add On provides a helpful tool as well as examples to help a user get familiar with how to stylize the front panel.

Additionally, common parts of a style sheet can be shared between applications in order to ensure the same look and feel is shared between applications.  This can be particularly helpful if multiple developers are working	on different software packages that will all be delivered to the same customer.  A style sheet can be defined that spells out things like background color and font size, and then applied to each application using the same methods.
