Full Description:
The 3D-MVL is a set of 3D machine vision tools to obtain complete, true, 3D calibrated data for ultrafast
shape analysis and measurements for in-line inspection on your manufacturing line.
3D-MVL means speed, accuracy, and reliability to machine builders, equipment manufacturers,
system integrators, and OEM demanding maximum flexibility and customization in their vision
systems.
The Library is the result of a close cooperation between ImagingLab (Lodi, Italy) and AQSENSE
(Girona, Spain).
