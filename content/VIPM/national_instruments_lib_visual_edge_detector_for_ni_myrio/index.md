Vendor: National Instruments

Author(s): National Instruments
 
Full Description:
The Visual Edge Detector for NI myRIO transforms your NI myRIO and USB camera into a high quality edge detector with an efficient algorithm and user-controlled threshold values.

This app runs on NI myRIO 1900 and 1950 targets.

To run this app:

1. Open LabVIEW
2. Select 'Create Project' from the Getting Started Window
3. Select the myRIO cateogry underneath Sample Projects
4. Choose the Visual Edge Detector for NI myRIO and complete the wizard to launch the project
5. Open RT Main.vi and Desktop Main.vi
6. Make sure you have plugged in a USB camera in to the USB port on the myRIO
7. Press the Run arrow on RT Main.vi then on Desktop Main.vi
8. Adjust the color threshold value and see the effect on the edge detection algorithm
9. Press Stop on each window to stop the app.

For more info, see the **How to Run Visual Edge Detector for NI myRIO** help document, available in the project created with the steps above.

*Note: This package requires VIPM 2014 for installation*
