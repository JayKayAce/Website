Full Description:
Real Time Power Electronics Teaching Software (cRIO9068) provides real-time simulation of DC-DC, AC-DC, DC-AC and AC-AC converters for educational purposes in power electronic laboratories. The heart of the system is real-time Electrical FPGA Hardware Solver (eHS), developed by OPAL-RT Technology. In this package students will learn the fundamentals of the Boost, Buck, Buck-Boost, 1-phase Rectifier, 3- phase Rectifier, 3-phase 2-level Inverter, and 3-phase 3-level Inverter through real-time simulations using cRIO. They also learn how to control these converters in a Hardware in Loop (HIL) structure using myRIO.
