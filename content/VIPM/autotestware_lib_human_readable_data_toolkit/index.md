Human Readable Data Toolkit is a collection of NI LabVIEW type VIs that provides a convenient method for: 

Representing LabVIEW graphical data objects as readable, editable text strings.
Inserting those text strings (HRD) into a database management system (DBMS) as a recordset.
Retrieving the HRD recordset from a DBMS.
Parsing the HRD back into LabVIEW data objects.

Human Readable Data Toolkit consists of the following VI palettes:

Human Readable Data:
LabVIEW Data to Human Readable Data
Human Readable Data to LabVIEW Data

DBMS:
A set of VIs for database connectivity and management of Human Readable Data for:
MS Access
MS Excel
MS SQL Server
MySQL
Oracle
NI DIAdem

Compare:
Two indispensable VIs that allow dynamic comparisons of data objects.

FastDev:
A VI that is a multifunctional tool for program development.
Producer/Consumer Queued State Machine environment. 
Designed for code reusability.  Modular, customizable, and expandable.
Integrated DBMS VIs and Comparator VIs for dynamic control of data parameters.
Ability to create sequences and collections of VI and inline code executions.
Usable as a debug tool, development platform, or automation executive.

String:
A set of VIs for tweaking strings and creating string search expressions.
