title: "DQMH (System)"
externalUrl: https://www.vipm.io/package/delacor_lib_dqmh_toolkit_system
summary: "This package installs all the packages needed for the Delacor QMH toolkit:
DQMH Palette
DQMH Project Template
DQMH Event Scripter
DQMH Thermal Chamber Examples

The DQMH project template is based on the National Instruments Queued Message Handler Project Template (NI QMH)

 The DQMH project template improves on the NI QMH by providing safe, event-based message handling and scripting tools to make development easy, encourage same style between different developers in the same project and improve efficiency

DQMH modules are best used in applications where there needs to be multiple modules running in parallel that communicate with each other

DQMH modules can also be used for applications that have a single module, where the developer would benefit from having an API Tester has the capability of eavesdropping on the different DQMH events and messages

Each module is implemented following a variation of the National Instruments Queued Message Handler and it has a Test DQMH Module API.vi to help troubleshoot, debug and eavesdrop on the communications between the DQMH Module and its calling code."
