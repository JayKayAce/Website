Full Description:
** Please make sure VIPM is running with Administrator privliges!!!**

** G2CPU GPU and CPU high performance computing toolkit Community Edition**

G2CPU is a general high performance computing library for LabVIEW based on ArrayFire.
Through the same code you can dynamically choose where the computational task is executed with absolutely no hassle. Code can be run on standard CPU's, Nvidia CUDA devices and OpenCL compatible devices.

**Community license **
The community edition is a free edition of G2CPU which is free to use by anyone for non-commercial actions.
Feel free to develop, learn and play. A perfect pairing with LabVIEW community edition.

Email toolsnetwork@ni.com to get your free license. 
Please provide the following details when doing so:
- First name
- Last name
- E-mail address
- Organization
- Computer ID (You can find this by going to the 'NI License Manager' and clicking 'computer information' in the top.)

** Note from NI Tools Network**
The Community license will not show up on your NI account, it will be a computer-based license so if you want to transfer the license to another system you would need to reapply for a new community license.

You have access to general arithmetic, array manipulation, signal processing, vector algorithms, machine vision and many more with even more to come.

**Supported Technologies **
* CPU *
When running code on you CPU the computational task is divided over multiple cores. Fully utilizing the CPU without the need for manual thread control.

* CUDA GPU's *
Maximize your computational power on Nvidia GPU's by using Nvidia's CUDA technology. 

* OpenCL GPU's *
Throug OpenCL you can run code on most commercial GPU's from all the big vendors like Intel, AMD and Nvidia. You can even run your code on the integrated graphics card on your CPU. (if available)

* Intel OneAPI </li>
	The Intel OneAPI is provides its own unified acces to hardware which ranges from CPU's, GPU's to even accelerators and FPGA's.
