Full Description:
Z-Wave is a low-power, low-cost wireless technology enabling consumer-grade products with networked features. Examples include remote controlled light dimmers, networked temperature sensors, electronic door locks and AV systems.. Z-Wave is based on ITU-T G.9959 standard. Z-Wave operates in the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands:  It uses 868.42 MHz in Europe and 908.42MHz in USA.

MaxEye Technologies provides generation and analysis functions in LabVIEW for generating and analyzing the Z-Wave standard complaint signals using National Instruments Vector Signal Generators (NI VSG) and Vector Signal Analyzers (NI VSA) or Vector Signal Transceivers (NI VST). The ITU-T G.9959 Standard supports three different data rates; 9.6kbps, 40kbps & 100kbps.

Note: VI Package Manager 2014 is required to install the package, before installing the package run LabVIEW as administrator.
