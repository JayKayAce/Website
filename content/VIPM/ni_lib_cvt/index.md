Full Description:
Machine control, automation, and application monitoring are typically all developed as independent processes running on one or more systems. Each process performs a distinct task but share a set of common data or variables which allow successful completion of all application tasks.

The Current Value Table (CVT) serves as the central data component and can be used in a wide range of applications. It allows application components to share a common data repository and have direct access to the most up-to-date value of any variable used between components. Using this architecture, one component in the application can handle all of the I/O operations, for example, and share the I/O data variables or tags with other application components. Application operations such as alarm detection, user interface updates, process logic, etc. can then be handled by separate processes, sharing the same data repository.

The CVT implementation is a two layer hierarchy consisting of core VIs and API VIs. The core contains all the functionality of the CVT, including the data storage mechanism and additional service functions. The API VIs provide access to the CVT functionality. You can choose from three groups of API functions that each provide slightly different access to the CVT and vary in flexibility, performance, and ease-of-use.

System Requirements
Application Software: LabVIEW Full Development System 2010 or later
