Vendor: Blue Origin

Full Description:
This small utility package provides a method to defer front panel updates given a control or VI reference.

This toolkit is particularly useful when being used in a nested manner.  The top-level callee will defer front panel updates, and the low level callees will be smart enough to not turn panel updates back on.
