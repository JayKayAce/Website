Vendor: National Instruments

Author(s): Allen C Smith
 
Full Description:
This package contains a library of VIs that abstracts the DOM-based XML API in LabVIEW for high-level operations. It also contains VIs that add whitespace to the generated XML to make it human-readable.

It provides an API for:
-	Adding a tag to an XML document
-	Adding whitespace to an XML string to make it human-readable
-	Saving a human-readable XML string to file

The API VIs are accessible from the Addons/National Instruments function palette in LabVIEW.

The package also installs an updated version of the example VI, 'Write Test Data File'. The updated version, named 'Write Test Data File - Simple', performs the same task using the Simple XML VIs.

Supported Targets
This package is compatible with LabVIEW 2013 (or later) on Windows only.
