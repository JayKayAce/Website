**Hardware Requirements:** 1-DOF Helicopter System (It contains NI myRIO, ACROME Power Distribution Unit, Brushless DC Motor, Incremental Rotary Encoder, Electronic Speed Controller(ESC) and Mechanics of the System(Beam, Base of the System,Balancing Block)

**Original Release Date:** 08-08-2018
**Current Revision Date:**09-08-2018
VI Package Manager 2017 is required to install the package.

** Description **
Explore the flight with 1-DOF Copter! Control the angle of the rotor arm with variable speed dc motor just like in quadcopters, rockets and hovercrafts in real world. Model the system, design your own controller, simulate the closed loop system and implement it with self contained flight control lab. A pedagogical cirriculum is ready for laboratory experiments which discusses main topics of control engineering such as system modeling, linearization, linear control system design and frequency response analysis. Students will gain high motivation and deep interest by comparing the experimental and expected data which come into the screen simultaneously.
