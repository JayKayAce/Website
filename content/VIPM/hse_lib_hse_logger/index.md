Vendor: Hampel Software Engineering GmbH

Author(s): Hampel Software Engineering
 
Full Description:
A flexible and extensible logging system inspired by the Python logging module.

For common logging tasks this logger library has a Quick-API which makes it very easy to integrate and use it in a project without caring about the LVOOP internals. The library provides five log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and two targets for the output (file handler, event handler). Because of the LVOOP design it is flexibly usable and every part of it can be extended with custom child classes to implement new features.
