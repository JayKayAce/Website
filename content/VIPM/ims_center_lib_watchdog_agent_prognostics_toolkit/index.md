Full Description:
The IMS Center Watchdog Agent Prognostics Toolkit for LabVIEW uses a patented analysis technique and industry-standard analysis to add ready-to-use prognostics and health management (PHM) algorithms and graphic displays to your NI LabVIEW applications. The toolkitâ€™s algorithms include neural networks, logistic regression, Gaussian mixture modeling, and statistical pattern recognition. You can use them to perform feature extraction and principal component analysis as well as pattern matching to detect and predict faults from critical machinery to power grids. By combining the powerful built-in analysis techniques with intuitive graphics such as self-organizing maps and health radar charts, the toolkit helps you build UIs that easily convey information about its predictions and analysis of the asset under test to your users.

This toolkit has been refined based on research at the National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (imscenter.net). It is a trademarked technology from the University of Cincinnati, developed through the pioneering work of the center under its director Professor Jay Lee. Combining the industry-proven research of the center with the DAQ and graphical display capabilities of LabVIEW software, the Watchdog Agent Prognostics Toolkit makes prognostics and prediction algorithms accessible to everyone. 

System Requirements
NI LabVIEW 2012 or Later
VI Package Manager 2014 or later
NI GXML Reference Library (http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/epd/p/id/6330)
Optional: some parts of this toolkit require NI Sound and Vibration Measurement Suite, Advanced Signal Processing Toolkit, and DAQmx.

This toolkit is not supported in LabVIEW Real-Time. It is designed to run on Windows host systems only.
