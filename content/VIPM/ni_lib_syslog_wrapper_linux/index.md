Vendor: National Instruments

Author(s): NI Systems Engineering
 
Full Description:
Simple, high-speed interface to syslog.
Approximately 10x faster than using RT Debug String method provided on palette, and opens all syslog options.
Expects .so file to be present in \\usr\\local\\lib on cRIO target.
Syslog-ng can be configured using the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file on the target.
Only works on NI Linux RT targets.  Will be a no-op on other targets.
