Full Description:
The VIs in this collection can train and execute a HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) object detector. This is a powerful detector for objects like traffic signs, faces, animals, etc.
The main features are:
- short training time
- very fast execution
- very low false detection rate
- good results even on a small number of training images
