Full Description:
This package install host example code for deploying an RTSA personality to several NI Kintex 7 user programmable FPGA targets.

**This package requries the following NI software:**
LabVIEW 2014
NI RFSA 14.1
NI FlexRIO 14.1

**This package requires the following NI hardware**
PXIe-5840 **or**
PXIe-5668R **or**

PXIe-5644R/45R/46R **or**
PXIe-5663/65/67

**and**

PXIe-7975R/76R **or**
PXIe-6591R/6592R


This package provides multiple examples that provide basic RTSA functionality, including persistence, spectrogram,and trace math plots, as well as frequency mask triggering.  The RTSA functionality exists exclusively as a bitfile for the PXIe-7976R, which recieves data via a peer-to-peer stream.

The package installs examples for performing each of these functions, as well as a demo panel which combines these features into one application.

To remain in compliance with US export control laws, the 100% POI duration is not better than 20 us under any circumstances.  If better performance is needed, please contact NI directly.
