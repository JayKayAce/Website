Full Description:
Description:
The PTG Pulse Train Generator (PTG) is developed for pulse sequence generation. A pulse train generator capable of giving trains of different types pulses and delays. The pulse data consist of name and complex waveform. Toolkit includes configuration Vi's for creating, changing, deleting and writing\\reading to file. This toolkit allow to generate signals based on hardware. The main advantage is capability with NI-RFSG. The behavior of the signals in output hardware is dictated by a script. 

Required NI Software
NI LabVIEW 2015 or later
NI-RFSG 15.0 or later

Supported Devices: NI 5644R/5645R/5646R, NI 5670/5671/5672/5673/5673E
