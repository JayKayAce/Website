Full Description:
This package allows taking advantage of WinSCP capabilities to perform file transfers between a PC and distant targets.
Base classes and a DQMH module are furnished to abstract the WinSCP API and allows easy transfer of files to/from a target. This implementation also allows sending non-blocking commands to distant target through SSH.

The DQMH module can be used as the principal API to WinSCP.
For more specific controle of the API, low level classes can also be used to program a particular application behavior.
