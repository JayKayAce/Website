Vendor: JKI

Author(s): JKI
 
Full Description:
The JKI State Machine™ is a template you can use for quickly creating your own LabVIEW applications. This is the very same template that is used by the JKI team, nearly every day, and is the result of years of refinement by our team of LabVIEW experts. We encourage you to post any questions or comments to the JKI Software Forums. There you will find an active community of JKI software users, as well as JKI team members.

How to use:

Find the JKI State Machine in the palettes
1) Functions >> JKI Toolkits >> JKI State Machine

Use QuickDrop to place a JKI State Machine on the block diagram
1)  Press Control+Space then type 'JKI'
2) choose the 'JKI State Machine' option that appears

Launch the JKI State Machine Explorer by either
A) Right-click on a State String, Case Structure, or Event Structure to launch JKI SM Editor
B) Press Control+Space then Control+J when you're on the block diagram of a VI containing a JKI SM

Using the Right-click menu on the JKI SM Parts for increased productivity:
- Select an item in the tree to make that frame visible
- Click back and forward to navigate the history
- Drag and drop frames to reorganize the order
- Right-click on items in the tree-view to rename, duplicate, delete, etc.
- Right-click on a state string and choose Goto State Frame to jump to that frame of the JKI SM.
- Right click on a state string or frame and choose Find Callers to find all callers of a state
- Right-click on a bundle or unbundle by name and choose Find Data Accessors to find all accessors of the data.

Special thanks to Jim Carmody for open sourcing his CaseSelect tool as a launching off point for the JKI SM Editor.
