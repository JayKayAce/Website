Vendor: Blue Origin

Author(s): Brent Justice
 
Full Description:
This package provides a debug log message abstraction layer.
There is no strict implementation here, only the definition of a debug log message interface.
As such, this package is very lightweight with very few dependencies.

The intent here is to provide a hook that other libraries and VIPM packages can use for writing internal debug log messages.  The calling application can then pick and implement a more specific debug logger.
