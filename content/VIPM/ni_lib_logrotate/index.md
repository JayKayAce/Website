Full Description:
LogRotate provides a LabVIEW API for archiving log files on a system.  The log file is 'rotated' into a series of archives whenever the log file exceeds a specific size limit.  The behavior of this API mimics a subset of the LogRotate functionality which is found in many Linux distributions.
