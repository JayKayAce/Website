Full Description:
**triniti™** is a new enabling technology from Gardasoft, which provides expert control, operational intelligence and full integration of Machine Vision Lighting — all within a 'plug-&-play' environment. With **triniti**, Machine Vision systems with LED Lighting are now much easier to create, configure and commission, while at the same time, offering increased functionality. This is because complex control techniques have now been made very easy to implement.
