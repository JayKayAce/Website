Full Description:
**About this tool:**
The Magic Delay Fairy fixes race conditions in your code by inserting magical delays into your code that are specifically tuned using advanced magical algorithms to fix your race conditions. Don't ask how it works, because it's magic.

**How to use this tool:**
Hit Ctrl+<space> to invoke QuickDrop then press Ctrl+F to invoke the Magic Delay Fairy and watch her do her magic. Before invoking the MDF, select error clusters to insert delays on error clusters, select objects to insert delays next to objects, or select nothing to place a delay on your block diagram. Delays are random, because that's how the magic works.
