title: "Malleable Buffer"
externalUrl: https://www.vipm.io/package/jdp_science_malleable_buffer
summary: "A Circular Buffer implimentation using Malleable VIs:
-- Any Type, 1D or 2D buffer array
-- Allows by-value, or DVR by-reference using the same API functions

Known Issue: LabVIEW compiler as of 2020 does not always recompile correctly
     --> use force recompile (hold ctrl key and click Run arrow); usually fixes
Issues seem resolved in LabVIEW 2021
