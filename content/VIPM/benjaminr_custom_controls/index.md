Full Description:
This package allows to use custom controls in your LabVIEW application :
- The buttons has been customized using Material Filled or Windows 11 icons.
- The Strings and Paths was designed based on Material Design guidelines.
- The Decorations was sketched to provide a nice way to graphically group or separate front panel objects without affecting the functionality of the VI. 

This package includes an utility VI to dynamically change the Decoration color on a specific VI Front Panel (accessible from the Addon>>BenjaminR>>Custom Controls category of the Functions palette).
