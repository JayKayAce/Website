Full Description:
The 'Algorithms after Dijkstra and Kruskal for Big Data' enables to find the shortest path between two points. Shortest path problems form the foundation of an entire class of optimization problems that can be solved by a technique called column generation. Examples include vehicle routing problem, survivable network design problem, find the shortest path from machine A to machine B.
