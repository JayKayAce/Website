Full Description:
**Overview**

NSRL CAS Interface is a user-friendly, lightweight and high performance interface between LabVIEW  and EPICS. It is designed to emulate an IOC and provides a convenient way to create a Channel Access Server in LabVIEW. NSRL CAS Interface follows IOC configuration style, by using .db files to configure records and loading these files to generate internal record sets, leading to rapid development and a stable and compact architecture. We set the type of record by sealing process variables (PVs) as record fields, with the same naming convention as IOC records. Thanks to the flexibility compared to traditional tools, users can also program on various control platforms.

**Finding Examples**

Select Help->Find Examples from LabVIEW to launch the NI Example Finder. Navigate to the NetWorking->EPICS folder to access the example. You can modify an example VI to fit an application, or you can copy and paste from the example into a VI that you create.
