Full Description:
This toolset adds various comparison functions:

- If data has changed from last call.
- Tests for even, odd, integer, and equivalent numbers. The Equivalency test will test if floating point numbers are equal to a given number of decimal places, and it will return True when comparing two NaNs for instance (which Equal won't per the IEEE 754 standard).
