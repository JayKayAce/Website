Full Description:
**CuLab** is an intuitive toolkit specifically designed for LabVIEW users, simplifying the acceleration of complex computations on **Nvidia GPUs**.
CuLab offers an extensive API, specifically tailored to accelerate essential functions, including mathematical operations (covering simple math, trigonometric, and exponential functions), Linear Algebra, signal generation and processing (FFT/IFF, correlation, convolution, resampling), and seamless array manipulation directly on GPUs.
One of CuLab's key features is its support for tensors, representing data structures on GPU, spanning all numeric data types and dimensionalities from 0D (scalars) to 4D arrays. This flexibility ensures compatibility with a wide range of data processing needs.
Designed with simplicity in mind, CuLab serves as a user-friendly bridge, enabling the acceleration of any data processing code developed in LabVIEW on Nvidia GPUs.
