Full Description:
The Pulse Train Generator on niUSRP is developed for pulse sequence generation. A pulse train generator capable of giving trains of different types pulses and delays. The pulse data consist of name and complex waveform. Toolkit includes configuration Vi's for creating, changing, deleting and writing\\reading to file. This toolkit allows to generate signals based on niUSRP hardware. The behavior of the signals in output hardware is dictated by a script.

System Requirements: 

Windows 7 or later operations system,

NI LabVIEW 2015 or later (32-bit), 

NI-USRP 15.0 or later.

NI LabVIEW Modulation Toolkit 15.0 or later.

Supported Devices: 

NI USRP-290x, USRP-292x/293x
