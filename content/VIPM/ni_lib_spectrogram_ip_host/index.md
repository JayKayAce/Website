Full Description:
This package provides the host library required for controlling a bitfile which contains the NI Spectrogram IP block.

The NI Spectrogram IP is used to compute a sequence of block averages on indexed waveforms which can then be displayed as a spectrogram, or waterfall plot, using a host application.
