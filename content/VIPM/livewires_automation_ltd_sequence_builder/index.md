**<u>Easy Configuration of Sequences for Your Process or Test System.</u>**

Many applications require a configurable 'sequence' or 'recipe' of multiple steps.  Writing a good 'sequence manager' is a sizeable task.  *Sequence Builder* does it all for you and gives you the routines for saving and loading your sequences.  Also included are 2 examples of how to incorporate the routines in your application and each of these examples makes a good template for a new sequence-based program.

Format:
 -  Sequence Code Builder utility (go to Tools Menu >> LiveWires Automation >> Sequesnce Builder)
 -  2 example programs (go to Help >> Find Examples, then select 'Directory Structure' on the Browse tab and navigate to LiveWires Automation\\Sequence Builder)
 - Support files stored in <Public Application Data>\\LiveWires Automation\\Sequence Builder\\VIs.  These must not be deleted or moved, but some can be modified.
 - Help file accessed by going to Help >> Livewires Automation >> Sequence Builder Help
