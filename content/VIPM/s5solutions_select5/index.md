Full Description:
Select5 is a simple, customizable Human/Machine interface designed to simplify Operator interaction with a test or research system.

Select5 is based around both NI Hardware and Software (DAQmx) and includes a simple API that provides easy interfacing and configuration.  Each of its 5 Button can be configured to be Momentary, Toggling, or Radio Buttons, and the each Button's Lamps can be under API or user control.  Interaction is provided either through a Polled API or User Events.

Requires NI DAQmx and the Select5 Hardware available at http://www.s5solutions.com/select5.html
