Full Description:
ADC Drivers FPGA Library

ADC Drivers FPGA Library includes drivers for the following analog-to-digital (ADC) converters.

1. MAX1300
The MAX1300 multirange, low-power, 16-bit, successive-approximation, analog-to-digital converter operates from a single +5V supply and achieves throughput rates up to 115kSPS.

2. ADS1271
The ADS1271 is a 24-bit, delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter with a data rate up to 105kSPS. 

3. AD7656
The AD7656 contains six 16-bit, fast, low power, successive approximation ADCs all in one package that is designed on the iCMOS™ process (industrial CMOS).

4. AD7732
The AD7732 is a high precision, high throughput analog front end. True 16-bit p-p resolution is achievable with a total conversion time of 500 µs (2 kHz channel switching), making it ideally suitable for high resolution multiplexing applications.

ADC drivers FPGA toolkit requires any FPGA enabled National Instruments' hardware, with corresponding daughter cards (3rd party).

Example projects included in the package require the following hardware for proper operation:

1. NI sbRIO-9606
2. NI sbRIO-9651
3. Daughter card/cards for NI sbRIO-9606 (3rd party) incorporating ADC AD7732 and/or AD7656
4. Daughter card/cards for NI sbRIO-9651 (3rd party) incorporating ADC MAX1300 and/or ADS1271

Note, VI Package Manager 2018 is required to install the package.
