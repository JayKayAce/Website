Vendor: Leah Edwards

Author(s): Leah Edwards
 
Full Description:
This QuickDrop Shortcut launches the TortoiseGit log for a VI, folder, library, repo, class, library or project. If you set up LVCompare as your TortoiseGit diff tool, the log is a handy way of selecting 1 or more log entries to diff. It saves having to come out of LabVIEW and find the file in Windows Explorer and navigating the huge TortoiseGit menu!

**Arguments for QuickDrop Window: **
   [nothing], file = this VI
   folder, f, [shift modifier] = folder of VI on disk
   repo, r = repo containing VI
   class, c = folder of class containing VI
   library, l = folder of library containing VI
   project, p = folder of project of VI

Default Shortcut - [G]
