Full Description:
WebPager at first glance is somewhat similar to Remote Panels. It **allows accessing LabVIEW front panel** from a browser with little modifications in the LabVIEW block diagram. But unlike Remote Panels, WebPager puts front panel into the web-page as a **pure HTML** interface - **no browser plugins, no LabVIEW Run-time Engine**. Only standard web-technologies - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript. WebPager maintains **quasi real-time control over front panel via Internet** from any browser-enabled device and operating system - Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iPad, etc. Moreover, WebPager also **provides API** for programmatic access of its functionality. Also, it can be used in a more flexible ways by programmatically merging LabVIEW front panel and external HTML code together for those with a good knowledge of web technologies, thus allowing having user interfaces and effects that are impossible to achieve on LabVIEW front panel itself.
